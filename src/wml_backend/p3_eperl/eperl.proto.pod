=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Abstract

ePerl interprets an ASCII file bristled with Perl 5 program statements by
evaluating the Perl 5 code while passing through the plain ASCII data. It can
operate in various ways: As a stand-alone Unix filter or integrated Perl 5
module for general file generation tasks and as a powerful Webserver scripting
language for dynamic HTML page programming.

=head2 Introduction

The B<eperl> program is the I<Embedded Perl 5 Language> interpreter. This
really is a full-featured Perl 5 interpreter, but with a different calling
environment and source file layout than the default Perl interpreter (usually
the executable B<perl> or B<perl5> on most systems).  It is designed for
general ASCII file generation with the philosophy of I<embedding> the Perl 5
program code into the ASCII data instead of the usual way where you embed the
ASCII data into a Perl 5 program (usually by quoting the data and using them
via C<print> statements).  So, instead of writing a plain Perl script like

  #!/path/to/perl
  print "foo bar\n";
  print "baz quux\n";
  for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { print "foo #${i}\n"; }
  print "foo bar\n";
  print "baz quux\n";

you can write it now as an ePerl script:

  #!/path/to/eperl
  foo bar
  baz quux
  <: for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { print "foo #${i}\n"; } :>
  foo bar
  baz quux

Although the ePerl variant has a different source file layout, the semantic is
the same, i.e. both scripts create exactly the same resulting data on
C<STDOUT>.

=head2 Intention

ePerl is simply a glue code which combines the programming power of the Perl 5
interpreter library with a tricky embedding technique.  The embedding trick is
this: it converts the source file into a valid Perl script which then gets
I<entirely> evaluated by only one internal instance of the Perl 5 interpreter.
To achieve this, ePerl translates all plain code into (escaped) Perl 5 strings
placed into F<print> constructs while passing through all embedded native Perl
5 code. As you can see, ePerl itself does exactly the same internally, a silly
programmer had to do when writing a plain Perl generation script.

Due to the nature of such bristled code, ePerl is really the better attempt
when the generated ASCII data contains really more static as dynamic data. Or
in other words: I<Use ePerl if you want to keep the most of the generated ASCII
data in plain format while just programming some bristled stuff.> Do not use it
when generating pure dynamic data. There it brings no advantage to the
ordinary program code of a plain Perl script. So, the static part should be at
least 60% or the advantage becomes a disadvantage.

ePerl in its origin was actually designed for an extreme situation: as a
webserver scripting-language for on-the-fly HTML page generation. Here you
have the typical case that usually 90% of the data consists of pure static
HTML tags and plain ASCII while just the remaining 10% are programming
constructs which dynamically generate more markup code. This is the reason why
ePerl beside its standard Unix filtering runtime-mode also supports the
CGI/1.1 and NPH-CGI/1.1 interfaces.

=head2 Embedded Perl Syntax

Practically you can put any valid Perl constructs inside the ePerl blocks the
used Perl 5 interpreter library can evaluate. But there are some important
points you should always remember and never forget when using ePerl:

=over 4

=item I<1. Delimiters are always discarded.>

Trivially to say, but should be mentioned at least once. The ePerl block
delimiters are always discarded and are only necessary for ePerl to recognize
the embedded Perl constructs. They are never passed to the final output.

=item I<2. Generated content has to go to C<STDOUT>.>

Although you can define subroutines, calculate some data, etc.  inside ePerl
blocks only data which is explicitly written to the C<STDOUT> filehandle is
expanded. In other words: When an ePerl block does not generate content on
C<STDOUT>, it is entirely replaced by an empty string in the final output.
But when content is generated it is put at the point of the ePerl block in the
final output. Usually contents is generated via pure C<print> constructs which
implicitly use C<STDOUT> when no filehandle is given.

=item I<3. Generated content on C<STDERR> always leads to an error.>

Whenever content is generated on the C<STDERR> filehandle, ePerl displays an
error (including the STDERR content). Use this to exit on errors while passing
errors from ePerl blocks to the calling environment.

=item I<4. Last semicolon.>

Because of the following point 6 (see below) and the fact that most of the
users don't have the internal ePerl block translations in mind, ePerl is smart
about the last semicolon. Usually every ePerl block has to end with the
semicolon of the last command.

   <: cmd; ...; cmd; :>

But when the last semicolon is missing it is automatically added
by ePerl, i.e.

   <: cmd; ...; cmd :>

is also correct syntax.  But sometimes it is necessary to force ePerl I<not>
to add the semicolon. Then you can add a ``C<_>'' (underscore) as the last
non-whitespace character in the block to force ePerl to leave the final
semicolon. Use this for constructs like the following

   <: if (...) { _:>
   foo
   <: } else { _:>
   bar
   <: } :>

where you want to spread a Perl directive over more ePerl blocks.

=item I<5. Shorthand for C<print>-only blocks.>

Because most of the time ePerl is used just to interpolate variables, e.g.

   <: print $VARIABLE; :>

it is useful to provide a shortcut for this kind of constructs.  So ePerl
provides a shortcut via the character '='. When it immediately (no whitespaces
allowed here) follows the begin delimiter of an ePerl block a C<print>
statement is implicitly generated, i.e. the above block is equivalent to

   <:=$VARIABLE:>

Notice that the semicolon was also removed here, because it gets automatically
added (see above).

=item I<6. Special EndOfLine discard command for ePerl blocks.>

ePerl provides a special discard command named ``C<//>'' which discards all
data up-to and including the following newline character when directly
followed an end block delimiter. Usually when you write

  foo
  <: $x = 1; :>
  quux

the result is

  foo

  quux

because ePerl always preserves code around ePerl blocks, even
just newlines. But when you write

  foo
  <: $x = 1; :>//
  quux

the result is

  foo
  quux

because the ``C<//>'' deleted all stuff to the end of the line, I<including>
the newline.

=item I<7. Restrictions in parsing.>

Every program has its restrictions, ePerl too. Its handicap is that Perl is
not only a rich language, it is a horrible one according to parsing its
constructs. Perhaps you know the phrase ,,Only F<perl> can parse I<Perl>''.
Think about it. The implication of this is that ePerl never tries to parse the
ePerl blocks itself. It entirely relies on the Perl interpreter library,
because it is the only instance which can do this without errors.  But the
problem is that ePerl at least has to recognize the begin and end positions of
those ePerl blocks.

There are two ways: It can either look for the end delimiter while parsing but
at least recognize quoted strings (where the end delimiter gets treated as
pure data). Or it can just move forward to the next end delimiter and say that
it have not occur inside Perl constructs. In ePerl 2.0 the second one was
used, while in ePerl 2.1 the first one was taken because a lot of users wanted
it this way while using bad end delimiters like ``C<E<gt>>''. But actually the
author has again revised its opinion and decided to finally use the second
approach which is used since ePerl 2.2 now. Because while the first one allows
more trivial delimiters (which itself is not a really good idea), it fails
when constructs like ``C<m|"[^"]+"|>'' etc.  are used inside ePerl blocks. And
it is easier to escape end delimiters inside Perl constructs (for instance via
backslashes in quoted strings) than rewrite complex Perl constructs to use
even number of quotes.

So, whenever your end delimiter also occurs inside Perl constructs you have to
escape it in any way.

=item I<8. HTML entity conversion.>

Because one of ePerl's usage is as a server-side scripting-language for HTML
pages, there is a common problem in conjunction with HTML editors.  They
cannot know ePerl blocks, so when you enter those blocks inside the editors
they usually encode some characters with the corresponding HTML entities. The
problem is that this encoding leads to invalid Perl code. ePerl provides the
option B<-C> for decoding these entities which is automatically turned on in
CGI modes. See description below under option B<-C> for more details.

=back

=head2 Runtime Modes

ePerl can operate in three different runtime modes:

=over 4

=item I<Stand-alone Unix filter mode>

This is the default operation mode when used as a generation tool from the
Unix shell or as a batch-processing tool from within other programs or
scripts:

  $ eperl [options] - < inputfile > outputfile
  $ eperl [options] inputfile > outputfile
  $ eperl [options] -o outputfile - < inputfile
  $ eperl [options] -o outputfile inputfile

As you can see, ePerl can be used in any combination of STDIO and external
files. Additionally there are two interesting variants of using this mode.
First you can use ePerl in conjunction with the Unix I<Shebang> magic
technique to implicitly select it as the interpreter for your script similar
to the way you are used to with the plain Perl interpreter:

  #!/path/to/eperl [options]
  foo
  <: print "bar"; :>
  quux

Second, you can use ePerl in conjunction with the Bourne-Shell I<Here
Document> technique from within you shell scripts:

  #!/bin/sh
  ...
  eperl [options] - <<EOS
  foo
  <: print "quux"; :>
  quux
  EOS
  ...

And finally you can use ePerl directly from within Perl programs by the use of
the Parse::ePerl(3) package (assuming that you have installed this also; see
file F<INSTALL> inside the ePerl distribution for more details):

  #!/path/to/perl
  ...
  use Parse::ePerl;
  ...
  $script = <<EOT;
  foo
  <: print "quux"; :>
  quux
  EOT
  ...
  $result = Parse::ePerl::Expand({
      Script => $script,
      Result => \$result,
  });
  ...
  print $result;
  ...

See Parse::ePerl(3) for more details.

=item I<CGI/1.1 compliant interface mode>

This is the runtime mode where ePerl uses the CGI/1.1 interface of a webserver
when used as a I<Server-Side Scripting Language> on the Web. ePerl enters this
mode automatically when the CGI/1.1 environment variable C<PATH_TRANSLATED> is
set and its or the scripts filename does I<not> begin with the NPH prefix
``F<nph->''.  In this runtime mode it prefixes the resulting data with
HTTP/1.0 (default) or HTTP/1.1 (if identified by the webserver) compliant
response header lines.

ePerl also recognizes HTTP header lines at the beginning of the scripts
generated data, i.e. for instance you can generate your own HTTP headers like

   <? $url = "..";
      print "Location: $url\n";
      print "URI: $url\n\n"; !>
   <html>
   ...

But notice that while you can output arbitrary headers, most webservers
restrict the headers which are accepted via the CGI/1.1 interface. Usually you
can provide only a few specific HTTP headers like C<Location> or C<Status>.
If you need more control you have to use the NPH-CGI/1.1 interface mode.

Additionally ePerl provides a useful feature in this mode: It can switch its
UID/GID to the owner of the script if it runs as a Unix I<SetUID> program (see
below under L<Security> and the option ``u+s'' of chmod(1)).

There are two commonly known ways of using this CGI/1.1 interface mode on the
Web. First, you can use it to explicitly transform plain HTML files into
CGI/1.1 scripts via the I<Shebang> technique (see above). For an Apache
webserver just put the following line as the first line of the file:

  #!/path/to/eperl -mc

Then rename the script from F<file.html> to F<file.cgi> and set its execution
bit via

  $ mv file.html file.cgi
  $ chmod a+rx file.cgi

Now make sure that Apache accepts F<file.cgi> as a CGI program by enabling CGI
support for the directory where F<file.cgi> resides. For this add the line

  Options +ExecCGI

to the F<.htaccess> file in this directory. Finally make sure that Apache
really recognizes the extension F<.cgi>. Perhaps you additionally have to add
the following line to your F<httpd.conf> file:

  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

Now you can use F<file.cgi> instead of F<file.html> and make advantage of the
achieved programming capability by bristling F<file.cgi> with your Perl
blocks (or the transformation into a CGI script would be useless).

Alternatively (or even additionally) a webmaster can enable ePerl support in a
more seemless way by configuring ePerl as a real implicit server-side
scripting language. This is done by assigning a MIME-type to the various valid
ePerl file extensions and forcing all files with this MIME-type to be
internally processed via the ePerl interpreter. You can accomplish this for
Apache by adding the following to your F<httpd.conf> file

  AddType      application/x-httpd-eperl  .phtml .eperl .epl
  Action       application/x-httpd-eperl  /internal/cgi/eperl
  ScriptAlias  /internal/cgi              /path/to/apache/cgi-bin

and creating a copy of the F<eperl> program in your CGI-directory:

  $ cp -p /path/to/eperl /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/eperl

Now all files with the extensions F<.phtml>, F<.eperl> and F<.epl> are
automatically processed by the ePerl interpreter. There is no need for a
I<Shebang> line or any locally enabled CGI mode.

One final hint: When you want to test your scripts offline, just run them with
forced CGI/1.1 mode from your shell. But make sure you prepare all environment
variables your script depends on, e.g. C<QUERY_STRING> or C<PATH_INFO>.

  $ export QUERY_STRING="key1=value1&key2=value2"
  $ eperl -mc file.phtml


=item I<NPH-CGI/1.1 compliant interface mode>

This runtime mode is a special variant of the CGI/1.1 interface mode, because
most webservers (e.g. Apache) provide it for special purposes.   It is known
as I<Non-Parsed-Header> (NPH) CGI/1.1 mode and is usually used by the
webserver when the filename of the CGI program is prefixed with ``C<nph->''.
In this mode the webserver does no processing on the HTTP response headers and
no buffering of the resulting data, i.e. the CGI program actually has to
provide a complete HTTP response itself. The advantage is that the program can
generate arbitrary HTTP headers or MIME-encoded multi-block messages.

So,
above we have renamed the file to F<file.cgi> which restricted us a little
bit. When we alternatively rename F<file.html> to F<nph-file.cgi> and force
the NPH-CGI/1.1 interface mode via option B<-mn> then this file becomes a
NPH-CGI/1.1 compliant program under Apache and other webservers. Now our
script can provide its own HTTP response (it need not, because when absent
ePerl provides a default one for it).

  #!/path/to/bin/eperl -mn
  <? print "HTTP/1.0 200 Ok\n";
     print "X-MyHeader: Foo Bar Quux\n";
     print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
  <html>
  ...

As you expect this can be also used with the implicit Server-Side Scripting
Language technique. Put

  AddType      application/x-httpd-eperl  .phtml .eperl .epl
  Action       application/x-httpd-eperl  /internal/cgi/nph-eperl
  ScriptAlias  /internal/cgi              /path/to/apache/cgi-bin

into your F<httpd.conf> and run the command

  $ cp -p /path/to/eperl /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/nph-eperl

from your shell. I<This is the preferred way of using ePerl as a Server-Side
Scripting Language, because it provides most flexibility>.

=back

=head2 Security

When you are installing ePerl as a CGI/1.1 or NPH-CGI/1.1 compliant program
(see above for detailed description of these modes) via

  $ cp -p /path/to/eperl /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/eperl
  $ chown root /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/eperl
  $ chmod u+s  /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/eperl

or

  $ cp -p /path/to/eperl /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/nph-eperl
  $ chown root /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/nph-eperl
  $ chmod u+s  /path/to/apache/cgi-bin/nph-eperl

i.e. with I<SetUID> bit enabled for the B<root> user, ePerl can switch to the
UID/GID of the I<scripts owner>. Although this is a very useful feature for
script programmers (because one no longer need to make auxiliary files
world-readable and temporary files world-writable!), it can be to risky for
you when you are paranoid about security of SetUID programs. If so just don't
install ePerl with enabled SetUID bit! This is the reason why ePerl is per
default only installed as a Stand-Alone Unix filter which never needs this
feature.

For those of us who decided that this feature is essential for them ePerl
tries really hard to make it secure. The following steps have to be
successfully passed before ePerl actually switches its UID/GID (in this
order):

  1. The script has to match the following extensions:
     .html, .phtml, .ephtml, .epl, .pl, .cgi
  2. The UID of the calling process has to be a valid UID,
     i.e. it has to be found in the systems password file
  3. The UID of the calling process has to match the
     following users: root, nobody
  4. The UID of the script owner has to be a valid UID,
     i.e. it has to be found in the systems password file
  5. The GID of the script group has to be a valid GID,
     i.e. it has to be found in the systems group file
  6. The script has to stay below or in the owners homedir

I<IF ONLY ONE OF THOSE STEPS FAIL, NO UID/GID SWITCHING TAKES PLACE!>.
Additionally (if C<DO_ON_FAILED_STEP> was defined as C<STOP_AND_ERROR> in
F<eperl_security.h> - not per default defined this way!) ePerl can totally stop
processing and display its error page.  This is for the really paranoid
webmasters. Per default when any step failed the UID/GID switching is just
disabled, but ePerl goes on with processing. Alternatively you can disable
some steps at compile time. See F<eperl_security.h>.

I<Also remember that ePerl always eliminates the effective UID/GID,
independent of the runtime mode and independent if ePerl has switched to the
UID/GID of the owner. For security reasons, the effective UID/GID is always
destroyed before the script is executed.>

=head2 ePerl Preprocessor

ePerl provides an own preprocessor similar to F<CPP> in style which is either
enabled manually via option B<-P> or automatically when ePerl runs in
(NPH-)CGI mode.  The following directives are supported:

=over 4

=item C<#include path>

This directive is an include directive which can be used to include really any
stuff, but was actually designed to be used to include other ePerl source
files. The I<path> can be either a relative or absolute path for the local
filesystem or a fully qualified HTTP URL.

In case of the absolute path the file is directly accessed on the filesystem,
while the relative path is first searched in the current working directory and
then in all directories specified via option B<-I>. In the third case
(HTTP URL) the file is retrieves via a HTTP/1.0 request on the network.
Here HTTP redirects (response codes 301 and 302) are supported, too.

Notice: While ePerl strictly preserves the line numbers when translating the
bristled ePerl format to plain Perl format, the ePerl preprocessor can't do
this (because its a B<pre>processor which expands) for this directive.  So,
whenever you use C<#include>, remember that line numbers in error messages are
wrong.

Also notice one important security aspect: Because you can include any stuff
as it is provided with this directive, use it only for stuff which is under
your direct control. Don't use this directive to include foreign data, at
least not from external webservers. For instance say you have a ePerl page
with C<#include http://www.foreigner.com/nice-page.html> and at the next
request of this page your filesystem is lost! Why? Because the foreigner
recognizes that you include his page and are using ePerl and just put a simple
``C<E<lt>?  system("rm -rf /"); !E<gt>>'' in his page. Think about it.
I<NEVER USE #INCLUDE FOR ANY DATA WHICH IS NOT UNDER YOUR OWN CONTROL>.
Instead always use C<#sinclude> for such situations.

=item C<#sinclude path>

This is the secure variant of C<#include> where after reading the data from
I<path> all ePerl begin and end delimiters are removed. So risky ePerl blocks
lost their meaning and are converted to plain text. Always use this directive
when you want to include data which is not under your own control.

=item C<#if expr>, C<#elsif expr>, C<#else>, C<#endif>

These implement a CPP-style C<#if-[#else-]#endif> construct, but with a Perl
semantic. While the other directives are real preprocessor commands which are
evaluated at the preprocessing step, this construct is actually just
transformed into a low-level ePerl construct, so it is B<not> actually
evaluated at the preprocessing step. It is just a handy shortcut for the
following (where BD is the currently used begin delimiter and ED the end
delimiter):

  ``#if expr''    ->  ``BD if (expr) { _ ED//''
  ``#elsif expr'' ->  ``BD } elsif (expr) { _ ED//''
  ``#else''       ->  ``BD } else { _ ED//''
  ``#endif''      ->  ``BD } _ ED//''

The advantage of this unusual aproach is that the if-condition really can be
any valid Perl expression which provides maximum flexibility. The disadvantage
is that you cannot use the if-construct to make real preprocessing decisions.
As you can see, the design goal was just to provide a shorthand for the more
complicated Perl constructs.

=item C<#c>

This is the comment directive which just discards all data up to and including
the newline character. Use this one to comment out any stuff, even other
preprocessor directives.

=back

=head2 Provided Functionality

Up to know you've understand that ePerl provides a nice facility to embed Perl
code into any ASCII data. But now the typical question is: Which Perl code can
be put into these ePerl blocks and does ePerl provide any special
functionality inside these ePerl blocks?

The answers are: First, you can put really I<any> Perl code into the ePerl
blocks which are valid to the Perl interpreter ePerl was linked with. Second,
ePerl does I<not> provide any special functionality inside these ePerl blocks,
because Perl is already sophisticated enough ;-)

The implication of this is: Because you can use any valid Perl code you can
make use of all available Perl 5 modules, even those ones which use shared
objects (because ePerl I<is> a Perl interpreter, including DynaLoader
support). So, browse to the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) via
http://www.perl.com/perl/CPAN and grab your favorite packages which can make
your life easier (both from within plain Perl scripts I<and> ePerl scripts)
and just use the construct ``C<use name;>'' in any ePerl block to use them
from within ePerl.

When using ePerl as a Server-Side-Scripting-Language I really recommend you to
install at least the packages F<CGI.pm> (currently vers.  2.36),
F<HTML-Stream> (1.40), F<libnet> (1.0505) and F<libwww-perl> (5.08).  When you
want to generate on-the-fly images as well, I recommend you to additionally
install at least F<GD> (1.14) and F<Image-Size> (2.3). The ePerl interpreter
in conjunction with these really sophisticated Perl 5 modules will provide you
with maximum flexibility and functionality. In other words: I<Make use of
maximum Software Leverage in the hackers world of Perl as great as possible>.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-d> I<name>=I<value>

Sets a Perl variable in the package C<main> which can be referenced
via C<$name> or more explicitly via C<$main::name>. The command

  eperl -d name=value ..

is actually equivalent to having

  <? $name = value; !>

at the beginning of I<inputfile>. This option can occur more than once.

=item B<-D> I<name>=I<value>

Sets a environment variable which can be referenced via C<$ENV{'variable'}>
inside the Perl blocks. The command

  eperl -D name=value ..

is actually equivalent to

  export name=value; eperl ...

but the advantage of this option is that it doesn't manipulate the callers
environment. This option can occur more than once.

=item B<-B> I<begin_delimiter>

Sets the Perl block begin delimiter string. Use this in conjunction with C<-E>
to set different delimiters when using ePerl as an offline HTML
creation-language while still using it as an online HTML scripting-language.
Default delimiters are C<E<lt>?> and C<!E<gt>> for CGI modes and C<E<lt>:> and
C<:E<gt>> for stand-alone Unix filtering mode.

There are a lot of possible variations you could choose: "C<E<lt>:>" and
"C<:E<gt>>" (the default ePerl stand-alone filtering mode delimiters),
"C<E<lt>?>" and "C<!E<gt>>" (the default ePerl CGI interface mode delimiters),
"C<E<lt>script language='ePerl'E<gt>>" and "C<E<lt>/scriptE<gt>>" (standard
HTML scripting language style), "C<E<lt>script type="text/eperl"E<gt>>" and
"C<E<lt>/scriptE<gt>>" (forthcoming HTML3.2+ aka Cougar style),
"C<E<lt>eperlE<gt>>" and "C<E<lt>/eperlE<gt>>" (HTML-like style),
"C<E<lt>!--#eperl code='>" and "C<' --E<gt>>" (NeoScript and SSI style) or
even "C<E<lt>?>" and "C<E<gt>>" (PHP/FI style; but this no longer recommended
because it can lead to parsing problems. Should be used only for backward
compatibility to old ePerl versions 1.x).

The begin and end delimiters are searched case-insensitive.

=item B<-E> I<end_delimiter>

Sets the Perl block end delimiter string. See also option B<-B>.

=item B<-i>

Forces the begin and end delimiters to be searched case-insensitive.  Use this
when you are using delimiters like
``C<E<lt>ePerlE<gt>>...C<E<lt>/ePerlE<gt>>'' or other more textual ones.

=item B<-m> I<mode>

This forces ePerl to act in a specific runtime mode.  See above for a detailed
description of the three possible modes: Stand-alone filter (I<mode>=C<f>,
i.e. option B<-mf>), CGI/1.1 interface mode (I<mode>=C<c>, i.e. option B<-mc>)
or the NPH-CGI/1.1 interface mode (I<mode>=C<n>, i.e. option B<-mn>).

=item B<-o> I<outputfile>

Forces the output to be written to F<outputfile> instead of F<STDOUT>. Use
this option when using ePerl as a filter. The outputfile ``F<->'' sets F<STDOUT>
as the output handle explicitly. Notice that this file is relative to the
source file directory when the runtime mode is forced to CGI or NPH-CGI.

=item B<-k>

Forces ePerl to keep the current working directory from where it was started.
Per default ePerl will change to the directory where the file to be executed
stays. This option is useful if you use ePerl as an offline filter on
a temporary file.

=item B<-x>

This sets debug mode where ePerl outputs the internally created Perl script to
the console (F</dev/tty>) before executing it. Only for debugging problems with
the inputfile conversion.

=item B<-I> I<directory>

Specify a directory which is both used for C<#include> and C<#sinclude>
directives of the ePerl preprocessor and added to C<@INC> under runtime.  This
option can occur more than once.

=item B<-P>

Manually enables the special ePerl Preprocessor (see above). This option is
enabled for all CGI modes automatically.

=item B<-C>

This enables the HTML entity conversion for ePerl blocks. This option is
automatically forced in CGI modes.

The solved problem here is the following: When you use ePerl as a
Server-Side-Scripting-Language for HTML pages and you edit your ePerl source
files via a HTML editor, the chance is high that your editor translates some
entered characters to HTML entities, for instance ``C<E<lt>>'' to ``C<&lt;>''.
This leads to invalid Perl code inside ePerl blocks, because the HTML editor
has no knowledge about ePerl blocks. Using this option the ePerl parser
automatically converts all entities found inside ePerl blocks back to plain
characters, so the Perl interpreter again receives valid code blocks.

=item B<-L>

This enables the line continuation character ``C<\>'' (backslash) outside
ePerl blocks. With this option you can spread oneline-data over more lines.
But use with care: This option changes your data (outside ePerl blocks).
Usually ePerl really pass through all surrounding data as raw data. With this
option the newlines become new semantics.

=item B<-T>

This enabled Perl's I<Tainting mode> where the Perl interpreter takes special
precautions called taint checks to prevent both obvious and subtle traps.  See
perlsec(1) for more details.

=item B<-w>

This enables Warnings where the Perl interpreter produces some lovely
diagnostics. See perldiag(1) for more details.

=item B<-c>

This runs a pure syntax check which is similar to ``C<perl -c>''.

=item B<-r>

This prints the internal ePerl README file to the console.

=item B<-l>

This prints the internal ePerl LICENSE file to the console.

=item B<-v>

This prints ePerl version information to the console.

=item B<-V>

Same as option B<-v> but additionally shows the Perl compilation parameters.

=head2 Provided Variables

=over 4

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_PATH>

The absolute pathname of the script. Use this when you want to
directly access the script from within itself, for instance to do
C<stat()> and other calls.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_DIR>

The directory part of C<SCRIPT_SRC_PATH>. Use this one when you want to
directly access other files residing in the same directory as the script, for
instance to read config files, etc.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_FILE>

The filename part of C<SCRIPT_SRC_PATH>. Use this one when you need the name
of the script, for instance for relative self-references through URLs.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_URL>

The fully-qualified URL of the script. Use this when you need a URL for
self-reference.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_URL_DIR>

The directory part of C<SCRIPT_SRC_URL>. Use this one when you want to
directly access other files residing in the same directory as the script via
the Web, for instance to reference images, etc.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_URL_FILE>

The filename part of C<SCRIPT_SRC_URL>. Use this one when you need the name of
the script, for instance for relative self-references through URLs.  Actually
the same as C<SCRIPT_SRC_PATH_FILE>, but provided for consistency.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_SIZE>

The filesize of the script, in bytes.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_MODIFIED>

The last modification time of the script, in seconds since 0 hours, 0 minutes,
0 seconds, January 1, 1970, Coordinated Universal Time.

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_MODIFIED_CTIME>

The last modification time of the script, in ctime(3) format (``WDAY MMM DD
HH:MM:SS YYYY\n'').

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_MODIFIED_ISOTIME>

The last modification time of the script, in ISO format (``DD-MM-YYYY
HH:MM'').

=item C<SCRIPT_SRC_OWNER>

The username of the script owner.

=item C<VERSION_INTERPRETER>

The ePerl identification string.

=item C<VERSION_LANGUAGE>

The identification string of the used Perl interpreter library.
