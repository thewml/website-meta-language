  This file summarizes *all* types of changes to the WML sources,
  i.e. changes between each patchlevel (1.x.y->1.x.(y+1) and
  1.x.y->1.(x+1).0). Take this logfile for concrete and detailed
  information about every single change.
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 2.0.8 and 2.0.9:

    *) Fix <directory-contents> (18-Oct-2002):
       Remove trailing newline.
       [Ralf Vissers <ravis@web.de>]

    *) Fix memory error in <array-shift> (18-Oct-2002):
       Some argument checks were missing in <array-shift> and could
       cause memory fault.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage <jms.debian@club-internet.fr>]

    *) Upgrade to mp4h 1.3.0 (18-Oct-2002):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix ePerl compilation (17-Oct-2002):
       Perl 5.8.0 has now thread support by default, which caused trouble
       when compiling ePerl.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Renamed 'aux' directory to 'data' (12-Oct-2002):
       Allows WML to be compiled under Cygwin.
       [Claus Faerber]

    *) Use '.' instead of '::' for man pages on Windows (12-Oct-2002):
       Allows WML to be compiled under Cygwin.
       [Claus Faerber]

    *) Use EXEEXT in configuration (12-Oct-2002):
       Allows WML to be compiled under Cygwin.
       [Claus Faerber <claus@faerber.muc.de>]

    *) Fix compilation on MS Windows (22-Jun-2002):
       [Darryl Smith <Darryl@radio-active.net.au>]

    *) Fix wml::sup::path (16-Jun-2002):
       canonpath('.///') did return '/' instead of './'
       [Florian Hars]

    *) Improve checks on file errors (20-Apr-2002):
       In passes 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 (ie Perl passes), file operations are
       checked and WML aborts if an error is detected.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove freetable comments in wml::fmt::xtable (10-Feb-2002):
       The -w flag now prints comments before generated table, whereas
       it used to omit it.  It is then omitted on freetable command line.
       [Thomas R. Koll <tomk32@tomk32.de>]

    *) Fix wml_p1_ipp (21-Dec-2001):
       Text added to let pass 3 retrieve filename and line numbers are
       protected against pass 2, because brackets could cause some trouble.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::des::typography (21-Dec-2001):
       The <spaced> tag could add ``&nbsp;'' within tags when interchar
       attribute was used.
       [Alvise Belotti]

    *) Fix wml::sup::path (18-Dec-2001):
       The canonpath function in wml::sup::path was buggy if path contains
       dots in directory names.
       [Tommi Vainikainen <thv@iki.fi>]

    *) Suppress warning in wml::std::toc (07-Nov-2001):
       A warning about wrong <preserve>/<restore> pairs could be raised
       when redefining <toc_section>, this is a long-standing bug which
       is revealed by an extra check added in recent mp4h.
       [Werner Heuser]

    *) Fix generic attributes in wml::des::navbar (05-Nov-2001):
       They were not always taken into account.
       [Clemens Oertel <oertel@uni-tuebingen.de>]

  Changes between 2.0.7 and 2.0.8:

    Note: since WML 2.0.5 there were two versions, stable and unstable.
          The former was numbered 2.0.N whereas the latter was 2.1aN.
          But I do not have time to manage those two separate trees,
          and there was no real benefit, so I am leaving this scheme.

    *) Fix locales in ePerl (28-Oct-2001):
       Locales broke ePerl with Perl > 5.6, with an odd error message:
       ``DynaLoader object version 1.04 does not match $DynaLoader::VERSION
       1 at DynaLoader.pm ...''
       [Martin Maechler <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>, Axel Beckert]

    *) Upgrade to linklint 2.3.5 (28-Oct-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Cleanup wml::des::navbar (26-Oct-2001):
       The urlopts attribute in navbar:define was documented but not
       implemented, it is replaced by generic attributes.
       [Werner Heuser <wehe@snafu.de>]

    *) Fix -W description in wmk usage summary (23-Oct-2001):
       [Martin Quinson <Martin.Quinson@ens-lyon.fr>]

    *) Upgrade to mp4h 1.2.2 (18-Oct-2001):
       Among other new features, the most significant for WML users
       may be the ability to define entities (in the SGML or XML sense)
       which could be seen as empty tags without attributes, and an
       experimental support of utf8,
       Note also that a leading space has been added to expansion of
       <attributes-quote> to ease writing HTML tags.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix detection of Perl modules (02-Oct-2001):
       Previous detection did use the Exporter::require_version method,
       which cause problem when modules are not setup with Exporter.
       New scheme only rely on normal `use MODULE VERSION' Perl function.
       [Blair Zajac <blair@orcaware.com>]

    *) Undefine variables on command-line (29-Sep-2001):
       Special construct -Dfoo=UNDEF undefine foo, if it was previously
       set by other command line options.  This is especially useful
       in .wmlrc files
       [Jan Holler]

    *) Upgrade wml_contrib/wml.vim (29-Sep-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wml_p5_divert (09-Sep-2001):
       This pass could be very slow with large files.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage]

    *) Fix documentation (26-Aug-2001):
       There was a documentation bug with example defining the <mail2>
       tag.
       [Rajendra Gokhale <rvg@creato.org>]

    *) Fixed various typos in manual pages (26-Aug-2001):
       Fixed various typos in manual pages wml_faq, wml::std::page
       and wml::std::info.
       [Thomas Lotterer <thomas.lotterer@cw.com>]

    *) Fix <protect> (17-Jul-2001):
       The pass= attribute is now case-insensitive.
       [Axel Beckert]

  Changes between 2.0.6 and 2.0.7:

    Note: timestamps have a single value because this 2.0.x branch did
          not receive support for a long time, so it has been decided
          to copy WML 2.1a2 into 2.0.7.

    *) Change <tli> in wml::des::typography (20-Jun-2001):
       It becomes a complex tag, as stated in documentation.
       [Craig Small]

    *) Fix compilation of Bit::Vector with perl < 5.005 (20-Jun-2001):
       Apply the 2001-08-29 patch by Max H. Duenki.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix nested ePerl tags implementation (19-Jun-2001):
       When <perl:assign> surrounds <perl:print>, output was not
       diverted to variables.  Quoting has also been fixed.
       [Petr Andreyev]

    *) Upgraded to Image::Size 2.93 (19-Jun-2001):
       Upgraded from 2.903 to 2.93
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p7_htmlfix (19-Jun-2001):
       When replacing <center> tags, it did not work if this tag has
       attributes.
       [Andreas Hoffmann]

    *) Fix wml::fmt::verbatim (19-Jun-2001):
       The <verbatim> tag could not be used in conjunction with
       wml::std::case,
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Fix diversion (19-Jun-2001):
       Parent dirs `..' could cause problems.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Upgraded to Bit::Vector 6.0 (19-Jun-2001):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix protection (19-Jun-2001):
       When both stdout and file names are specified by -o flags,
       unprotection was not performed on standard output.
       [Aymeric Poulain-Maubant <Aymeric.PoulainMaubant@jipo.com>]

    *) Update wml_contrib/wml.spec.in (19-Jun-2001):
       File wml_contrib/wml.spec was always outdated, so this new spec
       file allows automatic update, just run `make wml_contrib/wml.spec'.
       [Christian W. Zuckschwerdt]

    *) Fixed wml::std::href (19-Jun-2001):
       Removed extra newline after </a>.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage]

    *) Fixed wml::std::page (19-Jun-2001):
       Multiple pages capabilities was broken.
       [Jean-Michel Sauvage <jean-michel.sauvage@club-internet.fr>]

    *) Fixed wml::des::preload (19-Jun-2001):
       Javascript code was broken.
       [Andreas Hoffmann <hoffmana@mathematik.tu-muenchen.de>]

    *) Remove special characters in debugging output (19-Jun-2001):
       [Axel Beckert <rse-wml@deuxchevaux.org>]

    *) New <disjoin> tag (19-Jun-2001):
       This tag does the opposite job of <group>, it explodes its
       attribute into several pieces.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bug with body tag surrounded by quotes (19-Jun-2001):
       When a body function was surrounded within double quotes (without
       any whitespace around), it was simply discarded.
       [Petr Andreyev]

    *) New logos (19-Jun-2001):
       These new logos are about NetBSD, OpenBSD, PHP and XEmacs.
       [Wolfgang Dautermann]

    *) Upgraded to txt2html 1.28 (19-Jun-2001):
       The bug described just below has been fixed in txt2html 1.28, so
       changes in wml::fmt::text have been discarded.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::fmt::text (19-Jun-2001):
       Some characters are missing when text is not finished by a
       newline.  There are indeed some bugs in wml_aux_txt2html, so
       a workaround is to ensure there is always a newline in
       wml::fmt::text.
       [Frediano Ziglio <freddy77@angelfire.com>]

    *) Change transparency in wml::des::imgdot (19-Jun-2001):
       By default, transparency color was set to black.  Unfortunately,
       some browsers do not render transparent PNG images, and black
       backgrounds are not so frequent anymore. Default is now set to
       white, and may be changed by prepending an hyphen to the color
       attribute.
       [Craig Small <csmall@eye-net.com.au>]

    *) Improve wml_p5_divert (19-Jun-2001):
       Make a distinction betwwen URLs like `../foo' and diversion like
       ..NAME>> to improve speed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wml::des::navbar (19-Jun-2001):
       Any attributes can be added to <a> and <img> tags generated by
       <navbar::render>.  For instance it allows insertion of CSS
       attributes without having to modify wml::des::navbar.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wml_p7_htmlfix (19-Jun-2001):
       Trailing spaces in tags are fixed, i.e. all spaces before a
       right-angle bracket are removed (this have no influence on
       known server-side scripts) and a space is always inserted before
       ``/>'' to help rendering of XHTML documents by old browsers.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bugs with conditionals (19-Jun-2001):
       The <if>, <ifeq> and <ifneq> conditionals do not behave properly.
       Under rare circumstances, both THEN and ELSE clauses may be run.
       [Martin Schulze <joey@infodrom.north.de>]

    *) Fix nested ePerl tags implementation (19-Jun-2001):
       When <perl> tags are nested and are not enclosed within space
       characters, some output disappear.
       [Petr Andreyev <petr@xanadu.ru>]

    *) Fix wml::des::navbar (19-Jun-2001):
       When rendering tables, <navbar:jsfuncs/> is called even if navbar
       is not graphical, to make sure JavaScript functions used for
       rollover effect are always defined.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade ePerl to current CVS version (19-Jun-2001):
       [Ralf S. Engelschall, Denis Barbier]

    *) New `all except' operator in slice terms (29-Oct-2000):
       The wildcard sign accepts a new syntax.  When followed by braces,
       it replaces ``all strings but the one enclosed within braces''.
       This construct could not be emulated with previous operators with
       nested slices.
       This feature was introduced in Slice 1.3.7 on August 2000, but
       required few fixes to work with WML.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 2.0.5 and 2.0.6:

    *) Fix WMk (25-Oct-2000):
       This version of WMk is broken and cannot compile multilingual
       documents.
       [Max H. Duenki]

  Changes between 2.0.4 and 2.0.5:

    *) Improve wml::std::page (23-Oct-2000):
       Add an attribute ``color=none'' to remove color attributes in
       the <body> tag.
       [Wayne Schlitt <wayne@midwestcs.com>]

    *) Improve WMd customization (13-Oct-2000):
       The 02-May-2000 patch is improved, mapping is now done via an
       external file, so that wmd script needs no more being updated.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add wml_contrib/wml1to2 (02-Oct-2000):
       This script helps upgrading to WML 2.x by performing some
       changes in input files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::des::navbar (02-Oct-2000):
       The $menumode Perl variable was not initialized.
       [Anthony Fok]

    *) Improve flags handling (02-Oct-2000):
       Some flags require an argument, which is now quoted in case this
       argument contains spaces or shell metacharacters.
       [Albert Reiner <areiner@tph.tuwien.ac.at>]

    *) Fix infinite loop in wml_p8_htmlstrip (28-Sep-2000):
       WML hangs up when large text blocks are surrounded by
       <pre>...</pre> or similar tags.
       [Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>]

    *) Fix wml_p8_htmlstrip (27-Sep-2000):
       The <pre> and <xmp> tags were always converted to lowercase
       letters.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Fix compilation on AIX 4.3 (27-Sep-2000):
       The GD library did not compile because two unused routines depend
       upon undefined ones.  These useless routines are now removed.
       [Norbert Gruener <nog@mpa-garching.mpg.de>]

    *) Fix bug with conditionals in wml_p2_mp4h (27-Sep-2000):
       The <if> and <while> tags have strange results when first
       argument has a trailing slash, which is surely not so frequent.
       [Sebastian Wilhelmi <wilhelmi@ira.uka.de>]

  Changes between 2.0.3 and 2.0.4:

    *) Fix wml::mod::MakeMaker (19-Sep-2000):
       The `extradistfiles' attribute did not work.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix problems with synclines and protection (19-Sep-2000):
       The `synclines' feature was not documented in WML 2.0.3.
       It helps debugging by putting some special commands after
       pass 1 to keep track of input line numbers.
       Unfortunately, these extra commands will remain on output when
       included file is inside a protected area.
       This problem is now documented, and 2 solutions exist: either
       compile with `-W1,-N', or append the `IPP_NOSYNCLINES' special
       keyword to the #include line.
       [Many Debian people]

    *) Improve wml::des::navbar (16-Sep-2000):
       By default (called `inner' mode), epilog is put after sub-menu
       buttons, i.e. navbars are nested.  When <navbar:render> is called
       with attribute `menumode=outer', then sub-menus are inserted after
       epilog.
       [Tobias Oetiker]

    *) Make wml_p7_htmlfix customizable (16-Sep-2000):
       Two new options let the user decide which fixups are performed
       or skipped.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p7_htmlfix (13-Sep-2000):
       The version shipped with WML 2.0.3 is broken, there are problems
       with unquoted attributes containing a slash sign.
       [Roland Rosenfeld]

    *) Support w3m in addition to lynx in wmd (13-Sep-2000):
       The wmd command now searches through $PATH for w3m and lynx (and
       prefers w3m over lynx) instead of insisting on the existence of lynx.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgraded to LinkLint 2.2 (10-Sep-2000):
       Upgraded from LinkLint version 1.35 to version 2.2 after LinkLint
       changed from a (for WML not acceptable) shareware license to GPL.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall, James B. Bowlin <bowlin@sirius.com>]

  Changes between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3:

    *) Fix compilation of ePerl with threaded Perl 5.6.0 (03-Sep-2000):
       Providing portable code amongst several versions of Perl is a
       nightmare, functions prototypes and macros definitions have
       changed again.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_intro.pod (03-Sep-2000):
       It contains an erroneous reference to </define-container>
       [Benoit des Ligneris <benoit.des.ligneris@physique.usherb.ca>]

    *) Upgrade to mp4h 1.1.1 (31-Aug-2000):
       This release fixes many bugs added in mp4h 1.1.0 about non-ASCII
       letters.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix problems with @-sign in some module files (29-Aug-2000):
       The <perl:assign> tag is replaced by <perl:assign:sq> to prevent
       a problem with @-sign in input text.
       [Stephane Bortzmeyer]

    *) Upgrade to Slice 1.3.7 (29-Aug-2000):
       Fix a bug with Slice 1.3.6, which hangs up with some input files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix compilation of Bit::Vector with perl < 5.005 (29-Aug-2000):
       [Max H. Duenki]

    *) Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.1 (08-Aug-2000):
       Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.1. This especially fixed problems 
       with "shtool version" under Solaris.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (06-Aug-2000):
       Upgraded tidy from version 8jul00 to 04aug00.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p1_ipp (05-Aug-2000):
       Pass 1 hangs when a dollar sign appears in variable substitution.
       [Joey Smith <joey@joeysmith.com>]

    *) New variables WML_SRC_TIME and WML_GEN_TIME (04-Aug-2000):
       These variables ease customizing date formats.
       [Fritz Zaucker]

    *) Add alternative for mouse events (03-Aug-2000):
       The onmouseover and onmouseout event handlers are seconded
       by onfocus and onblur, to allow rendering with any device.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add `summary' attribute in tables (03-Aug-2000):
       This tag is automatically added by wml_p7_htmlfix, because
       it helps rendering by non-graphical browser, exactly like
       ALT attribute for <img>.
       [Stephan Petersen]

    *) Fix protection in wml (01-Aug-2000):
       Output files are generated by wml_p9_slice.  This program has
       a useful feature, output file names may be specified in
       pseudo shebang lines.  But these lines may occur anywhere in
       input file, not only on its beginning.
       As wml has to know which files are generated to unprotect them
       after pass 9, input file must be parsed before wml_p9_slice is
       called to determine output files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Allow nestable <protect> tags (31-Jul-2000):
       This tag is now much more user-friendly, it may be nested, and
       its syntax is similar to the -p flag, i.e. it accepts also a comma
       separated list of individual passes.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve processing speed on large files (30-Jul-2000):
       On large files, most of processing time is spent in
       passes 7, 8 and 9.  This performance problem is induced by
       Perl, which does not seem to work efficiently with regular
       expressions on huge datas.  The provided solution is to split
       input into smaller chunks.
       This procedure is quite conservative, i.e. it is not fully
       optimized to ensure that output is never altered by this
       operation.
       A speedup factor of 10 is obtained on those 3 passes with
       files larger than 200KB (which may be caused by a huge input
       file splitted into many HTML output files).
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of Bit::Vector (24-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded Bit::Vector from version 5.7 to 5.8.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Update all WML module files for XHTML 1.0 (21-Jul-2000):
       In WML module files, all simple tags have now a trailing
       backslash to allow both HTML and XHTML input and output.
       It is important to notice that this does not break compatibility,
       output is exactly the same by default.  But now users can decide
       which syntax to adopt via the -X flag of wml_p2_mp4h.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add support for modifiers in regexps in wml_p2_mp4h (21-Jul-2000):
       Only i, m, s and x modifiers have been added, U and X are
       specific to PCRE and have not been implemented.
       The `singleline' attribute has been changed.  It now accepts
       two values, `true' (like the s modifier) and `false' (like the
       m modifier).  Until now, `m' was the default, and singleline=true
       switches to `s'.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Finish import of PCRE in wml_p2_mp4h (21-Jul-2000):
       Native API is now used, and support for locales is back.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Many fixes for multilingual navbars (21-Jul-2000):
       Some bugs were introduced by recent changes in wml::std::tags
       and wml::des::navbar.
       [Stephan Petersen]

    *) Improve wml::std::lang (20-Jul-2000):
       Thanks to PCRE, <lang:area> has been rewritten entirely with
       mp4h commands, so now all lang tags can be nested.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Use Perl regular expressions in wml_p2_mp4h (20-Jul-2000):
       The PCRE library is copyrighted by University of Cambridge.
       With this library, Perl regular expressions may now be
       used instead of POSIX regular expressions.
       Current implementation in mp4h is quite weak, because we use
       the POSIX compatibility mode instead of native API.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve <javascript> tag in wml::std::tags (19-Jul-2000):
       When a complex <head> tag is defined, like in wml::std::page,
       all JavaScript material is passed to this command in order to
       be put inside the HEAD section.
       This behaviour is disabled with the `nohead' attribute or by
       defining <javascript:nohead> with a non-empty value.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_p1_ipp (19-Jul-2000):
       Previous changes broke `make test'.
       [Stephan Petersen]

    *) Improve wml::std::lang (19-Jul-2000):
       Language slices can now be nested, the reason is to allow
       constructs like ``<en><lang:star:href: index.*.html></en>''.
       This can not be easily handled by wml_p9_slice (any suggestions
       to do so are welcome), and so wml::std::lang has been patched
       to forbid nesting of different languages by redefining <en>,
       <lang:en> tags (and of course all other defined languages) and
       all <lang:star...> tags.
       Unfortunately multi-lingual zones enclosed between <lang:area>
       and </lang:area> do not yet allow this nesting.
       Two new tags are introduced, <lang:current> always returns
       the language being currently processed, and <lang:list> returns
       the newline separated list of defined languages.
       [Stefan `Sec` Zehl]

    *) Fix file name and line numbers on warnings (18-Jul-2000):
       Pass 1 now prints some control sequences to let pass 2 and 3
       know about original filename and line number instead of
       locations in temporary files.  This is very useful for debugging.
       It can be turned out with -W1,-N flag.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix a bug when using both -M and -W1 flags (16-Jul-2000):
       Options set with -W1,... were not passed to wml_p1_ipp.
       [Ilya Martynov <m_ilya@agava.com>]

    *) Upgrade of the Bare Bones Guide to HTML (13-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded from version 3.0 to 4.0.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (13-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded tidy from version 30nov99 to 8jul00.
       Dave Raggett included submitted patches to make gcc quiet,
       so only few changes have been made in upstream sources.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Internal changes in mp4h about regular expressions (06-Jul-2000):
       Mp4h now uses the POSIX functions of the GNU libc regex.c instead
       of old GNU functions.  The most important reason for this change
       is that previous functions are not documented, and so hard to
       maintain.
       Moreover i had to patch the regex functions to allow the
       ``singleline=true'' attribute.
       With this new version it works out of the box, and many memory
       leaks are also fixed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix boolean operators (05-Jul-2000):
       The <and> tag was broken, and <or> has been cleaned up.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve <preserve>/<restore> stuff (05-Jul-2000):
       These tags accept now any number of arguments, so it is possible
       to write
           <define-tag foo>
           <preserve name src text>
           <set-var %attributes>
           ... code using `name', `src' and `text' variables.
           <restore  name src text>
           </define-tag>
       All module files have been updated in consequence.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix whitespace in wml::des::preload (03-Jul-2000):
       The javascript code was not protected against newlines removal,
       and resulting code is ugly.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Rewrite wml::*::all files (03-Jul-2000):
       These modules include all files from a specific category.
       When inclusion is made with wildcards, some files which have been
       removed from WML distribution, but were not deleted by user when
       upgrading, may be called accidentally.  So they now explicitly 
       invoke the desired files.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.0 (01-Jul-2000):
       Upgraded to GNU shtool 1.5.0. This involved especially a major
       adjustment because of the rewritten "shtool version" command.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Enhanced wml::std::tags' <javascript> tag (27-Jun-2000):
       Added four additional attributes to the <javascript> container
       tag of wml::std::tags: "src", "language" and "type" to directly
       specify the corresponding attributes for the underlaying <script>
       tag, and "version" which is a convinient attribute to specify the
       JavaScript version as used in the default "language" attribute.
       Example: ``<javascript version=1.2 src=foo.js>'' now expands
       into ``<script type="text/javascript" language="JavaScript1.2"
       src="foo.js">...</script>''
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix wml::sys::all manpage (27-Jun-2000):
       The wml::sys::all manpage talked about no longer existing 
       wml::sys::xxx includes.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix escaped quotes in wml::std::href (24-Jun-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix <divert> in wml::std::tags (24-Jun-2000):
       It was impossible to use exclamation marks with this tag
       as described in wml_p5_divert.
       [Fritz Zaucker]

  Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2:

    *) Update mp4h (22-Jun-2000):
       New version is mp4h 1.0.2, with many enhancements since pre-1.0
       releases.  The most important one is that `grammar' has been
       entirely rethought.  After discussions on the WML mailing-list
       it is clear that users want tag expansion mechanism to be simple.
       Unfortunately, because WML runs many independant passes, each
       one with its own syntax, i could not provide a simple mechanism.
       But i try to keep it as simple as possible.
       Last but not least, this new version makes WML 2.0.2 much more
       compatible with WML 1.x than previous WML 2.x releases, and
       optional features allow experienced users to deal with either
       HTML or XHTML files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove stars in tag names (15-Jun-2000):
       The wml script now removes stars after and before tag names.
       Read mp4h documentation to learn why this is needed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::std::grid (15-Jun-2000):
       An error was raised with arrobas sign in cells.
       [<middelink@polyware.nl>]

    *) Fix wml_p8_htmlstrip (15-Jun-2000):
       The <suck> tag may now be written <suck/> or <suck /> to conform
       to new standards.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::fmt::verbatim (08-Jun-2000):
       This module was compromised because of nested protection tags,
       which are not valid yet.
       [Howard Alexander LaHurreau <alexdw@locl.net>]

    *) Fix wml::des::typography (07-Jun-2000):
       The <spaced> tag was broken.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix documentation of wml::std::page (02-Jun-2000):
       The WML_PAGE_* slices are actually WML_STDPAGE_* and
       are only available if the "slices" attribute is used.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix wml::std::lang (01-Jun-2000):
       It was broken with default wildcard.
       [Corsin Decurtins <corsin@student.ethz.ch>]

    *) Fix compilation bug in wml_p2_mp4h (01-Jun-2000):
       [<gaa@ulticom.com>]

    *) Provide a way to read tokens without parsing (01-Jun-2000):
       All characters between <@[ and ]@> are read without parsing,
       this is very useful to read malformed mp4h tags.  These
       delimiters may be changed with the <set-quotes> tag.
       [Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch>]

    *) Fix wml_p8_htmlstrip (31-May-2000):
       Pass 8 preserves whitespace inside <pre>, <xmp> or <nostrip>
       complex tags.  When these tags have attributes, whitespaces were
       removed.
       [Tom Gilbert <gilbertt@linuxbrit.co.uk>]

  Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.0.1:

    *) Add missing documentation in wml::des::typography (23-May-2000):
       The <tul> and <tli> macros were not documented.
       [Franz Knipp, Alvise Belotti]

    *) Fix WMd (23-May-2000):
       Installation path of WML manpages is searched before $MANPATH,
       and not after.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Numerous bugfixes and clean-ups in include files (23-May-2000):
       Perl code in include files must be protected against expansion
       during pass 2 because some constructs are now parsed (take great
       care of left-angle brackets).
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change evaluation of unknown tags (22-May-2000):
       Until WML 2.0.0, unknown tags are treated like normal text,
       i.e. left angle bracket lose their special meaning.  This has
       very strange side effects when such tags appear in attributes.
       This feature has been discarded so that old pages still compile.
       [many people]

    *) Fix installation of preformatted manpages (22-May-2000):
       An undocumented change in Makefiles installed preformatted
       manpages under $(mandir)/manX instead of $(mandir)/catX. By
       default the subdirectory name is now again `cat', but can
       overridden via the new --with-catdir configure option
       (usually one would use --with-catdir=man).
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix wml_p2_mp4h documentation (16-May-2000):
       Some French words were present in English version.
       [Franz Knipp]

    *) Fix wml::std::tags to remove extra newlines (16-May-2000):
       Because of the definition of <perl:print>, some extra newlines
       was added.
       [Franz Knipp]

  Changes between 1.99.9 and 2.0.0:

    *) Add documentation: wml_macros (08-May-2000):
       This document explains how to write macros with mp4h allowing
       nestable ePerl commands.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix trailing slash inside empty elements (06-May-2000):
       When there was no attribute and no space before the slash sign,
       as in <br/>, this tag was not expanded.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Cosmetics for Autoconf procedure (04-May-2000):
       A few cosmetical cleanups to let the WML auto-configuration
       procedure look more homogenous, although it still is a
       combination of Autoconf scripts from various separate packages.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of Image::Size (04-May-2000):
       Upgraded Image::Size module from versiom 2.901 to latest 2.903.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Improve WMk (04-May-2000):
       The file $HOME/.wmkrc is parsed when found.
       It is now possible to tell wmk to skip some directories containing
       no input files.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.99.8 and 1.99.9:

    *) L10n changes in mp4h (03-May-2000):
       I do not know how to deal with locales in a portable way, so
       examples are removed from documentation.  Only English
       documentation is build, but you may continue to compile the
       French one if your environment variables are rightly set.
       This point is important: previously locales was set to C and
       changed by <mp4h-l10n>.  Now locales are initialized to those
       defined by user environment.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Syntax change in the <let> tag (03-May-2000):
       New syntax is <let cmd1=cmd2>, similar to TeX and more
       user friendly.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of iselect (02-May-2000):
       Upgraded to iselect 1.2.0, with some clean ups.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (02-May-2000):
       Upgraded to tidy 30apr00
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wmd (02-May-2000):
       Some vendors do not include third-party programs in WML,
       because these programs are still part of the system.  This
       confuses wmd, because program names do not match, and some
       manpages may be missing.
       A mapping between names is implemented to help solve these
       problems, and a `WML missing document' manpage is provided too.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_aux_freetable (01-May-2000):
       Freetable removes linebreaks in cells, which is confusing if
       javascript comments are used.
       [Timo Neumann <james@userland.de>]

    *) Fix wml_p7_htmlfix (27-Apr-2000):
       Wml_p7_htmlfix was confused when attribute values contain
       some Server Side scripting,
       [Laurent Riesterer <riesterer@celar.fr>]

    *) Run compiled tidy on HTML documentation in Pass 2 (20-Apr-2000):
       HTML documentation of p2_mp4h is post-processed by tidy.  We
       must use the version shipped within WML since older may break
       compilation.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix compilation on some platforms (20-Apr-2000):
       [Stephane Bortzmeyer]

    *) Fixed various build warnings (19-Apr-2000):
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix compilation of Term::Readkey (18-Apr-2000):
       [Joerg Plate]

    *) Better handling of trailing slashes (18-Apr-2000):
       It was very difficult to prevent suppression of trailing slash
       in attributes.  Now it can be done by putting spaces between this
       slash and the closing bracket.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

  Changes between 1.99.7 and 1.99.8:

    *) Fix compilation on FreeBSD (17-Apr-2000):
       Perl modules did not install properly under FreeBSD.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Minimize `gfont' calls in wml::des::gfont (13-Apr-2000):
       When an image is generated, gfont command line is put into a
       text file.  On next run, this file is read and gfont will not be
       re-run if command lines are identical.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix bug in wml_p1_ipp with include files (13-Apr-2000):
       This bug allowed an include file to be inserted more than once
       with only one invocation, if it was found under distinct
       directories.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.99.6 and 1.99.7:

    *) Upgraded to GetOptLong 2.23 (08-Apr-2000):
       Upgraded from GetOptLong version 2.20 to version 2.23.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix bugs with extra quotes in attributes (Pass 2) (04-Apr-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.99.5 and 1.99.6:

    *) Fix bug in grouping (Pass 2) (02-Apr-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Remove a trailing slash in attributes (02-Apr-2000):
       When reading attributes of single tags, a trailing slash is
       ignored.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.99.4 and 1.99.5:

    *) Fix compilation with perl 5.6.0 (01-Apr-2000):
       [jack@needle.mudshark.org]

    *) Upgrade mp4h (01-Apr-2000):
       Upgrade from 0.8.5 to 0.9.0.
       Add support for localization.
       Customization of number output format.
       Important changes in array functions: <array-append> is
       renamed into <array-push>, its counterpart <array-pop> is defined
       and first argument of array-related functions is now variable name.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Implicit array indexes in wml_p2_mp4h (29-Mar-2000):
       The expression <get-var foo[i]> is a shorthand for
       <get-var foo[<get-var i>]>.
       [Jan Holler <jh@inetcom.ch>]

    *) Fix wml::std::tags (29-Mar-2000):
       Because of new stuff introduced into wml::std::tags to allow
       ePerl nested commands, some extra linefeeds were present in
       output file.
       [Roland Rosenfeld]

    *) Fix checking of exit status of wml_aux_tidy (29-Mar-2000):
       [Roland Rosenfeld]

    *) Remove garbage introduced by WML shebang lines (29-Mar-2000):
       WML shebang line with trailing backslash leaves some garbage in
       output file.
       [Roland Rosenfeld]

  Changes between 1.99.3 and 1.99.4:

    *) Renamed wml::sys::bootp2 into wml::sys::compat1 (27-Mar-2000):
       This module provides backward compatibility with WML 1.x and
       is no more included by default.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade mp4h (26-Mar-2000):
       Upgrade from 0.8.3 to 0.8.5.
       The quoted=true attribute of the <group> tag is removed and this
       feature is now provided by the <noexpand> tag. Its counterpart is
       <expand>.
       New attribute of <group> : ``separator=string''
       Fix some memory leaks.
       Fix bug with some nested expressions.
       [Denis Barbier, Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Add <return> tag (20-Mar-2000):
       This tag exits from inner macro.
       [Uwe Mindrup]

    *) Add %name in replacement text (20-Mar-2000):
       This special string expands to the macro name when found in
       replacement text.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix a bug in wml_p2_mp4h (18-Mar-2000):
       Letters `A' and `U' after a percent sign were gobbled by mp4h
       in macro replacement text.
       [Joerg Plate <Joerg@Plate.cx>]

  Changes between 1.99.2 and 1.99.3:

    *) Upgrade freetable (19-Mar-2000):
       Upgrade from 0.6 to 0.11
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed some include files (19-Mar-2000):
       Minor fixes, documentation update.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improved wml::std::grid (19-Mar-2000):
       A summary attribute is added.
       [Joerg Plate]

    *) Fixed wml_p1_ipp (19-Mar-2000):
       IPP failed with expressions like ?$(foo). It is fixed and
       features introduced in wml-1.99.0 are rewritten.
       [Anthony Fok, Franz Knipp]

  Changes between 1.99.1 and 1.99.2:

    *) Fix wml::std::lang (18-Mar-2000):
       The <lang:star:> tag was broken since wml-1.99.0
       [Max H. Duenki <duenki@isi.ee.ethz.ch>]

    *) Fix a bug in wml_p2_mp4h (18-Mar-2000):
       Letters `A' and `U' after a percent sign were gobbled by mp4h
       in macro replacement text.
       [Joerg Plate <Joerg@Plate.cx>]

    *) Upgrade GNU shtool (18-Mar-2000):
       Upgraded to GNU shtool version 1.4.8. This especially
       speeds up the "make install" step (now 30s instead of 44s ;)
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Various Cleanups (18-Mar-2000):
       Added Sub Directory Prefix (SDP) to Makefiles for p2_mp4h and
       fixed various warnings which occured under gcc (2.95.2) and -Wall
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  Changes between 1.99.0 and 1.99.1:

    *) Warning printed when an obsolete pass 2 macro is called (16-Mar-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix a bug with empty output file (16-Mar-2000):
       A previous bugfix fix caused wml to freeze when an empty output
       file is processed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add macro hooks in wml_p2_mp4h (15-Mar-2000):
       These hooks are provided to allow inserting text before or after
       macro expansion. This way it becomes easy to transform primitives
       or defined macros.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix build failure of wml_p2_mp4h on FreeBSD (15-Mar-2000):
       There was a bug in wml_backend/p2_mp4h/lib/xmalloc.c which causes 
       a build failure on FreeBSD.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Changed printing of ISO dates (15-Mar-2000):
       All ISO dates are now printed in the yyyy-mm-dd format.
       [Kurt D. Zeilenga]

  Changes between 1.7.4 and 1.99.0:

    *) Improved WMk (12-Mar-2000):
       The -F flag may be used to avoid scanning directories and not
       only files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Changed processing of -S and -I flags of wml_p1_ipp (12-Mar-2000):
       These flags are now processed from right to left, so that adding
       them into .wmlrc files override previous definitions.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Processing of input files residing in other directories (12-Mar-2000):
       When an input file is on another directory, wml now goes to this
       directory before parsing .wmlrc files. The main goal of this
       design change is to support the VPATH feature of GNU make, to
       allow building files in a test area.
       Old behaviour is also available via the -c flag.
       Note that WMk has *NOT* been changed because this change has been
       introduced for people who prefer Makefiles to WMk.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix invocation of tidy as an epilogue program (12-Mar-2000):
       So called ``epilog filters'' are not filters, so documentation
       call them ``programs'' now.
       Tidy can be invoked with ``-E tidy''
       [Roland Rosenfeld <roland@spinnaker.rhein.de>]

    *) Added recent W3C Recommandations (12-Mar-2000):
       HTML 4.01, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0
       and XHTML 1.0.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Added syntax highlighting configuration file for Vim (12-Mar-2000):
       See wml_contrib/wml.vim
       [Gerfried Fuchs]

    *) Removed Text::BlockParser and Text::DelimMatch (12-Mar-2000):
       These Perl modules were previously used by IPP for block
       comments. This feature has been suppressed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed protection (11-Mar-2000):
       When a <protect pass=N> tag is not processed by pass N, either
       because this pass is skipped or because protect tags are nested,
       this protection will pollute output file.
       [Franz Knipp]

    *) Improved wml_p1_ipp (10-Mar-2000):
       Numerous improvements in pass 1: variables can now be nested,
       continuation lines are allowd on #include lines, and new variables
       are added to ease generation of slide shows.
       Block comments are suppressed because many people seem to use WML
       to show their C listing.
       [Franz Knipp]

    *) Updated most include files to work with mp4h (13-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Replaced Meta-HTML by mp4h for pass 2 (13-Feb-2000):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Added wml::std::label (13-Feb-2000):
       This new module implements label/references macros.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Changed names of bootstrap files (13-Feb-2000):
       The files wml::sys::bootmhc, wml::sys::boot and wml::sys::bootgm4
       are renamed to wml::sys::bootp2, wml::sys::bootp3 and
       wml::sys::bootp4.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed <protect> problem with pass 9 (12-Feb-2000):
       It is possible to dynamically change output filenames, by
       writing a shebang line interpreted during pass 9. For this
       reason, WML must check the presence of such a shebang line and
       change output filenames, which are needed for unprotection
       after pass 9.
       [Wolfgang Dautermann]

    *) Fixed wml::des::preload (10-Feb-2000):
       As preloading is only performed on images, there is no reason
       to check filename extension.
       [Franz Knipp <franz@knipp.org>]

    *) Fixed rc file search path within WMk (04-Feb-2000):
       When WMk is called recursively, the search path for .wmkrc files
       was never cleared and these files were read more than once.
       [Craig Wiegert <wiegert@quintessence.uchicago.edu>]

    *) Syntax change in wml_p5_divert (21-Jan-2000):
       The bugfix in wml_p5_divert (19-Sep-1999) had a major drawback:
       it slows down pattern search algorithm. To improve this new
       version, end delimiter must be at least 2 characters long.
       This new end delimiter is now ``:#NAME#}'', and for symmetry
       begin delimiter is ``{#NAME#:''.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Replace wwwtable by freetable (11-Jan-2000):
       Tomasz Wêgrzanowski <maniek@beer.com> wrote a GPL'd replacement
       for wwwtable, and is actively maintaining it. 
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of File::PathConvert (08-Jan-2000):
       Upgraded File::PathConvert from version 0.83 to 0.85.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of Bit::Vector (08-Jan-2000):
       Upgraded Bit::Vector from version 5.6 to 5.7.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of Getopt::Long (08-Jan-2000):
       Upgraded Getopt::Long from version 2.19 to 2.20.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve wml::des::rollover (08-Jan-2000):
       When no href attribute is set, rollover is made but images
       are not clickable.
       [Stephan Petersen <sp@gtt.lth.rwth-aachen.de>]

    *) Improve wml::des::imgbg (06-Jan-2000):
       A new attribute is introduced to specify the size of the image
       in the ``alternate'' direction.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Change some name of generated images (06-Jan-2000):
       In wml::des::imgbg, wml::des::imgdot and wml::std::logo,
       names of generated images do not depend on the source filename.
       [Thomas Akin]

    *) Define a global base name for generated images (06-Jan-2000):
       When set, the IMAGE_BASE variable defines a base name for
       every generated image to group all such images into a
       single directory.
       This base name can be overridden by usual attributes.
       [Thomas Akin <takin@kennesaw.edu>]

    *) Improve support of PNG format (06-Jan-2000):
       All logos and generated images are available in PNG or GIF
       formats.  This choice is defined by the IMAGE_FORMAT variable
       (default is gif) and may be overridden by the ``format''
       attribute.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Replace GD Perl library to allow PNG and GIF images (06-Jan-2000):
       Old GD version supported only GIF format whereas newer one
       only support PNG. This is because GD is a wrapper to the gd
       library by Thomas Boutell, and he decided to stop dealing with
       GIF format because of a patent hold by Unisys.
       This decision does not make sense to my point of view, his
       library was using the `run length encoding' compression and not
       the patented LZW algorithm.
       So i patched the gd library to allow generation of both formats.
       WML use this library to draw lines and rectangles, and i removed
       unused stuff (fonts, polygons, arcs, ...) to freeze this code.
       To avoid conflicts with installed GD.pm, this modified version
       has been renamed to WML::GD.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Added logos (04-Jan-2000):
       New logos for ht://Dig, gimp and php3.
       [Wolfgang Dautermann]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (03-Jan-2000):
       Upgraded tidy from version 27sep99 to 30nov99.
       Like Ralf did with previous version, some cleanups are performed
       on source files to let gcc happy with -Wall flag.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::std::href to allow @ sign within URLs (03-Jan-2000):
       When an @ sign was present within an URL, wml::std::href
       always assumed this URL to be an e-mail address.
       [Wolfgang Dautermann <dauti@oeh.tu-graz.ac.at>]

    *) Many changes for compatibility with mhc and mp4h (29-Nov-1999):
       The wml_p2_mhc program is replaced by wml_p2_mp4h.  Changes are
       needed in frontends and include files to allow both programs in
       pass 2.  This is a temporary fix to perform benchmarks and other
       comparisons.  A definitive fix will be submitted before next
       release.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Allow @ operator in slice specifications  (22-Nov-1999):
       The @ operator is valid in wml_p9_slice, but WML did not
       allow this operator in slice specifications.
       [<cc@clasohm.com>]

    *) Fix missing wml_p3_eperl documentation (13-Nov-1999):
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Wmk did not recognize the -M option (08-Nov-1999):
       [Hans Ulrich Niedermann]

    *) Add a notag attribute to <logo> (29-Oct-1999):
       This attribute has the same functionality as within <gfont>.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Allow nesting of wml_p3_eperl commands (29-Oct-1999):
       The ePerl processor cannot be called recursively. Then all
       WML commands which invoke pass 3 could not be nested. Include
       files concerned with this problem have changed to detect these
       nestings and automatically insert appropriate code.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Added PNG versions of logos (25-Oct-1999):
       WML must improve its support for PNG format. Logos in that
       format are included in the distribution, and wml::std::logo
       has a new ``format'' attribute.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix configure bugs with some Perl versions (24-Oct-1999):
       The patch between WML-1.7.2 and WML-1.7.3 did not work because
       autoconf had not been run.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura]

    *) Fixed the <verbatim> tag (24-Oct-1999):
       This tag was protected against pass 6, which cause wrong output.
       [l_martin@worldnet.fr]

    *) Fixed wml_aux_wwwtable and wml::fmt::xtable (23-Oct-1999):
       The <caption> tag did not work as described in the documentation
       and tables can now be nested.
       [hortiz@neurobio.upr.clu.edu]

    *) Change how color of links are used in wml::des::navbar (18-Oct-1999):
       The two attributes txtcol_select and txtcol_normal were joined to
       the navbar:define tag. They are now part of the navbar:render
       tag, which seems more logicial to me.
       For backward compatibility, they are not removed from the
       <navbar:define> tag, but are overridden if set in <navbar:render>.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Improve documentation (18-Oct-1999):
       The PAGER and TMPDIR environment variables are now documented.
       [Hans Ulrich Niedermann]

    *) Added new variables for GMT timezones (18-Oct-1999):
       All current WML variables refer to local time. Kurt asked for
       a way to use GMT timezone too, which is especially useful for
       web sites of projects whose developers live worldwide.
       [Kurt D. Zeilenga]

    *) Fixed WMu (18-Oct-1999):
       When WMu is unable to read information files from the web server,
       it exited with a very unclear error message. It is fixed and tell
       now the user which file could not be downloaded.
       [Kurt D. Zeilenga]

    *) Fix infinite loops when parsing options (11-Oct-1999):
       Under some circumstances an infinite loop occurred when parsing
       options. When an infinite loop is detected, an error is now
       reported.
       [Hans Ulrich Niedermann]

    *) Fixed weblint (07-Oct-1999):
       The wml_aux_weblint script required newgetopt.pl. It now
       use the Getopt::Long package shipped with WML.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed documentation of include files (06-Oct-1999):
       Added GD.pm in the list of requirements when needed.  Some links
       were missing in all.src files.
       [Jarda Benkovsky <pvt.benkovsk@pvtnet.cz>]

  Changes between 1.7.3 and 1.7.4:

    *) Modules conformance to recent changes in wml_p5_divert (04-Oct-1999):
       Changes in wml::std::page and wml::mod::MakeMaker to conform to
       the new preferred way of writing diversions.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgraded GNU shtool (04-Oct-1999):
       Upgraded the GNU shtool scripts in the source tree 
       to the latest version 1.4.6.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fix performance issue with wml_p5_divert (03-Oct-1999):
       The bugfix on wml_p5_divert in the previous version caused
       wml_p5_divert to run dramatically slow. This problem is fixed.
       [Anthony Fok]

    *) Fix wmk (03-Oct-1999):
       When wmk invokes wml, shell metacharacters on the command line
       are not escaped in this version, because of a bug introduced
       in WML-1.7.3.
       [Jan Ulrich Hasecke]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (01-Oct-1999):
       Upgrade from tidy26jul99 to tidy27sep99.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Various changes in Makefile.in files (30-Sep-1999):
       I add my cosmetics touch too, to let these files more
       homogeneous.
       Important changes to let ``make'' stop when an error occur in
       ``all'' and ``install'' targets, whereas it could continue
       when cleaning up build tree.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Cleanup $(RANLIB) usage for Meta-HTML (30-Sep-1999):
       Use $(RANLIB) the correct Autoconf-way in the Meta-HTML subtree.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Various cosmetics (30-Sep-1999):
       Various cosmetic changes inside the source tree to
       make my aesthetic eye happy again.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  Changes between 1.7.2 and 1.7.3:

    *) Fix wml::std::logo (27-Sep-1999):
       Fixes default logo to wml.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of tidy (25-Sep-1999):
       Upgrade from tidy15apr99 to tidy26jul99.
       [Alvise Belotti]

    *) Fix wml::std::grid (22-Sep-1999):
       The ``height'' attribute must be applied to cells, and not
       tables.
       [Jacques Supcik <supcik@ip-plus.net>]

    *) Fix wml::sup::path (21-Sep-1999):
       The ``canonpath'' routine is modified to return ``./'' instead
       of an empty string ; this fixes problems with wml::des::navbar
       and other include files.
       This patch is also applied to ipp.src, wmk.src and wml.src
       [Hans Ulrich Niedermann]

    *) Add documentation in wml::des::navbar (19-Sep-1999):
       The nohints attribute of the <navbar:render> tag was missing.
       [Hans Ulrich Niedermann <ulrich@niedermann.bb.bawue.de>]

    *) Fix the <include> tag (19-Sep-1999):
       When files are included via the <include> tag, the
       <*parser*::push-file> and <*parser*::pop-file> tags were
       printed, but these tags were removed from wml_p2_mhc.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Allow any pass order (19-Sep-1999):
       The -p option of WML allow users to specify which pass are to
       be invoked ; in wml-1.7.3, when pass specifications are followed
       by an exclamation mark, passes are not sorted.
       [Xose Manoel Ramos <xmanoel@bigfoot.com>

    *) Accepts any suffix in input fle names (19-Sep-1999):
       Many files are updated to accept any input file suffix. Temporary
       files take the same suffix of the input file.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix the :NAME#} construction in wml_p5_divert (19-Sep-1999):
       The wml_p5_divert accepts two equivalent sets of commands. As for
       now, the preferred one is ``<<NAME>> ..NAME>> <<NAME..''. But
       those angle brackets cause trouble in conjunction with wml_p2_mhc,
       so documentation is updated to prefer alternative commands
       ``{#NAME#} {#NAME:  :NAME#}''.
       Moreover a bug has been fixed with the ``:NAME#}'' command.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix configure bugs with some Perl versions (19-Sep-1999):
       Some Perl versions, like the EUC JP one caused an error when
       running the configure script.
       [Andrew S. Howell <andy@tibcofinance.com>]

    *) Fix compilation of wml_p2_mhc (19-Sep-1999):
       Build wml_p2_mhc with the C compiler found at configure
       time, and not necessarily gcc.
       [Lars Kellogg-Stedman <lars@larsshack.org>]

    *) Bug fix : 1-char directory name (10-Sep-1999):
       Wmk and wml did not handle right 1-char directory name.
       [Nico Galoppo <scratch@ace.ulyssis.student.kuleuven.ac.be>]

    *) Fix the --without-openworld configure option (09-Sep-1999):
       The --without-openworld did not work as expected, it is fixed.
       [Gerfried Fuchs <alfie@innocent.com>]

    *) Fix the __FILE__ automatic variable in wml_p1_ipp (06-Sep-1999):
       The __FILE__ variable did not work as expected because of a
       problem with scope.
       [Nobuyuki Tsuchimura <tutimura@nn.iij4u.or.jp>]

    *) Use of the TMPDIR environment variable (28-Aug-1999):
       To conform with POSIX standard, this variable contains
       the directory name where temporary files are kept. By default,
       this directory is /tmp.
       [Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de>]

    *) Use GNU shtool for configuring (25-Aug-1999):
       All scripts in etc/ sub-directories were still replaced by
       Ralf's shtool since 01-Jul-1999. They are now removed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix include files (23-Aug-1999):
       In all include files, perl ``system'' function is replaced by
       backticks, to allow error reporting.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Write empty file during pass 9 (23-Aug-1999):
       On latest version, empty output files were not written. It has 
       been changed to suppress this error
           cannot load /tmp/wml.xxx.tmp4 for unprotection at
           /usr/bin/wml line 658.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New wml_include/mod/version.src (21-Aug-1999):
       Provides the <require> tag to indicate a minimal WML version
       number to process a given file.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml::fmt::verbatim (20-Aug-1999):
       Added <protect></protect> to insert files really verbatim
       [Thomas Roessler <roessler@guug.de>]

    *) New wml_include/mod directory (20-Aug-1999):
       This directory is devoted for modularity. The first include file
       is MakeMaker.src, a Makefile generator to distribute WML modules.
       It is inspired by the ExtUtils::MakeMaker Perl module.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Add wml_contrib/mkwml (20-Jul-1999):
       This Perl script is an alternative to wmk.
       [Jim Bowlin <bowlin@sirius.com>]

    *) Fix the --safe long option name (19-Jul-1999):
       The --speedup option was used instead of --safe in wmk.src and
       wml.src
       [Simon Burr <simes@bpfh.net>]

    *) Better detection of relative paths in navbar.src (19-Jul-1999):
       When including images, absolute pathnames were either paths
       beginning with a slash or with ``http://''. Obviously other
       cases may occur, e.g. with ftp. The new algorithm is inspired
       from the URI perl module.
       [Dave Plonka <plonka@doit.wisc.edu>]

    *) Allow quotes around pass numbers in <protect> tags (09-Jul-1999):
       [Davor Cengija]

    *) Fix variable evaluation in Pass 1 (09-Jul-1999):
       The regular expression used to substitute variables in wml_p1_ipp
       was wrong with two adjacent variables, like $(foo)$(bar).
       [Uwe Mindrup <uwe@mindrup.de>]

    *) Fix installation of Perl modules (05-Jul-1999):
       On some platforms, Perl modules are not installed under
       ...prefix/lib/wml/perl.
       Rules in Makefiles now invoke pure_perl_install
       [Tobias Oetiker]

    *) Define a WML environment variable (01-Jul-1999):
       Contains the path of the wml binary. It is needed to perform
       tests on wmk when wml is not yet installed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) More robust -D flag (01-Jul-1999):
       A variable defined with the -D flag could not contain spaces or
       metacharacters. It's fixed now, one can write
           -DFOO="this \"and that\""
       on the command line, the shebang line, in RC-files or in the
       environment variable WMLOPTS.
       [<simes@bpfh.net>, Jim Hebert]

    *) Improve dependency checking (09-Jun-1999):
       If output files depend on certain data files, one may tell WMk
       about these dependencies by using the new ``#depends''
       directive.  File is not included but dependency is updated.
       The metacharacters [?*] are allowed in file names after #use
       #include and #depends. Bracketed expressions are also recognized.
       [Jay Treacy <treacy@debian.org>]

    *) Enhanced wml::fmt::verbatim (08-Jun-1999):
       Add the <verbatim-file> tag which is much more readable than
       the perl wml_fmt_verbatim routine.
       [Tobias Oetiker]

    *) Makes ePerl more portable (08-Jun-1999):
       ePerl uses the ppport.h file to deal with old and new perl.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Clean-up include files (06-Jun-1999):
       Simplification have been done in include files to use the new
       Meta-HTML tags.
       All references to the /tmp directory have been replaced by the
       WML_TMPDIR variable.
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.7.1 and 1.7.2:

    *) Fix wml::fmt::text (22-Jun-1999):
       This file needs wml::std::tags.
       [Bruno Boettcher <bboett@erm1.u-strasbg.fr>]

    *) Fixed wml_include/all.wml (09-Jun-1999):
       Removed wml::usr::all, which is no more relevant.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed dependency checks (08-Jun-1999):
       When touching template files, wmk does not rebuild targets.
       [Alexander Graefe <wa0191@stud.uni-wuppertal.de>]

    *) Fix wml::des::navbar (08-Jun-1999):
       wml_p3_eperl returns an error if a button id begins with a zero.
       If no select attribut is set in <navbar:render>, then all buttons
       are selected.
       [Jan Ulrich Hasecke and Christian Zuckschwerdt <zany@darkride.net>]

    *) Fix the ``end of line'' bug in wml_p2_mhc (08-Jun-1999):
       When the last character of the file is not a newline, strange
       results occur.
       [Jan Ulrich Hasecke]

  Changes between 1.7.0 and 1.7.1:

    *) Fixed mhc (05-Jun-1999):
       When defining new tags, the %0...%9 and %attributes are expanded
       in Meta-HTML 5.02 (pass 2) whereas they are unevalled in 5.09.
       This breaks the preserve/restore stuff defined in wml::std::tags.
       So the former behavior is restored.
       [John Bazik]

    *) Rewrite some include files (05-Jun-1999):
       Replace ``%0 %1 ... %9'' by ``%attributes'' in include files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed WMu (05-Jun-1999):
       To upgrade WML, the recommended way is to use WMu.
       It worked only when invoked by the super-user.  This bug fix
       allows a user to get and build WML, and then su root to install
       it. 
       [Denis Barbier]

  Changes between 1.6.8 and 1.7.0:

    *) Enhance documentation (30-May-1999):
       WMd sorts keyword search results by hit count.
       Some changes in the FAQ.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Check epilog and prolog filters (27-May-1999):
       Wml and friends now report an error and exit when a prolog or
       epilog fail.
       [Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch>]

    *) Improve WMk (26-May-1999):
       WMk know recognizes the -o option in .wmkrc. If the -o option is
       used in .wmlrc, it's the only way to inform WMk about
       dependencies.
       [Fritz Zaucker]

    *) Clean Makefiles (21-May-1999):
       ``make distclean'' was broken and htmlclean didn't build on some
       systems
       [Frederic Le Mouel <Frederic.LeMouel@irisa.fr>]

    *) y2k fixes (20-May-1999):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Variable definitions (14-May-1999):
       The -Dfoo is now equivalent to -Dfoo=1 and -Dfoo="" or -Dfoo=
       define an empty variable.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Enhanced wml and wmk (11-May-1999):
       The -W option allows passing option to a specific pass, e.g.
          wml -W3,-i
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Import HTML-Clean 0.7 (11-May-1999):
       HTML-Clean is a perl module written by
           Paul Lindner <paul.lindner@itu.int>
           http://people.itu.int/~lindner/
       The wml_aux_htmlclean may be used as an epilog filter to reduce
       the size of webpages
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Update Perl modules (11-May-1999):
          GetoptLong      2.19
          Image-Size      2.901
          TermReadKey     2.14
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Import tidy15apr99 (11-May-1999):
       Tidy is an HTML cleaner up
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Enhanced wml::des::imgbg (10-May-1999):
       Allow generation of gradient backgrounds.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Import slice-1.3.2 (10-May-1999):
       Import the source distribution of slice 1.3.2 and patch it to
       ease its inclusion into wml.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml.src (9-May-1999):
       Remove an obsolete trick for writing portable dates
       [John Bazik <jsb@cs.brown.edu>]

    *) Add tests (9-May-1999):
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix wml_backend/p3_eperl/eperl_sys.c (7-May-1999):
       A bug prevented recursive calls of ePerl.
       [Stéphane Bortzmeyer]

    *) Enhanced wml::des::navbar (7-May-1999):
       Multi-lingual navbars are easier to use, and menus can be nested.
       Automatic buttons (up, next, prev).
       Add the ``nohints'' attribute.
       [Denis Barbier, Florian Hars, Tobias Oetiker]

    *) Fixed documentation (7-May-1999):
       Tiny fixes
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Enhanced wml::std::lang (10-Apr-1999):
       Wildcard used in <lang:star:... > tags can be changed. These tags
       are also protected against pass 3 to ease writing multi-lingual
       navigation bars
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed wmk (2-Apr-1999):
       When output files were defined via the wml shebang line, wml was
       always invoked.
       [Jan Ulrich Hasecke <juh@pironet.de>]

    *) Enhanced time dependency checks for wmk (29-Mar-1999):
       The dependency checking with wmk now applies to every input file,
       not only the main one. This is performed with the -MM wml option.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Added wml_contrib/navbar-FH.wml (26-Mar-1999):
       This is a modified version of navbar.wml which implements nested
       and multi-lingual navbars.
       [Florian Hars <florian@hars.de>]

    *) Fixed wml::des::navbar (22-Mar-1999):
       When a navbar is used more than once, the rendering of rollover
       is wrong, the rollover apply only to the last navbar.
       The ``nopreload'' attribute is a good idea, but with a wrong
       implementation. It is deleted, its action will be performed by
       htmlfix or htmlstrip.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Automatic dependency generation (18-Mar-1999):
       An `-M' option has been added to wml and wml_p1_ipp to write
       `make'-rules, as gcc does.
       [Andreas Hofmeister <hofmeist@informatik.uni-freiburg.de>]

    *) Fixed cleanup (16-Mar-1999):
       A ``make clean'' deletes wml_test/TEST.root
       [Frederic Le Mouel <Frederic.LeMouel@irisa.fr>]

    *) Fixed wml_p9_slice (16-Mar-1999):
       An undefined slice reports a warning instead of an error
       [Michael McNamara <mac@surefirev.com>]

    *) Enhanced wml::std::tags (16-Mar-1999):
       The m4 stuff has been fixed to allow nested definitions in the
       ``symbol'' tag and use of non-standard m4 quotes.
       [stiegele@informatik.uni-freiburg.de]

    *) Changed bootstrapping (16-Mar-1999):
       Passes 2, 3 and 4 have their own dedicated files into
       wml_include/sys. For backward compatibility reasons, the
       sys/boot.wml file has not be renamed.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Easier multi-lingual interface (16-Mar-1999):
       The processing of multi-lingual documents is much easier,
       providing an alternative to the -o option with the
       lang:star:slice: tag.
       [Denis Barbier, Paul Sponagl <pablo@acmedia.de>]

    *) Enhanced wml (12-Mar-1999):
       A variable may now be defined without value, in which case
       its value is empty. This is the only way to undefine variables.
       The %BASE/%DIR trick on output files is performed after all
       configuration files are read, so that it can be invoked
       in .wmlrc or even on the command-line.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed ipp (12-Mar-1999):
       The -i wml option did not work as explained in the doc for
       system files.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed wmd (21-Feb-1999):
       When invoking ``Keyword search'', manpages were searched in
       a wrong place and no results were found.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Enhanced wml::std::toc (18-Feb-1999):
       Two new styles (ul and ol) are implemented. Both allow complete
       control on how lists are displayed.
       The hspace style has been rewritten to include one gif of width
       20xN instead of N gifs of width 20.
       The toc_hN macros accept a new "alt" attribute, which will be
       inserted in the ToC instead of the body function. As for now,
       the %attributes was inserted, which did not follow the WML api
       and could cause strange behaviors when quoting.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Cleaned up wml_p2_mhc (16-Feb-1999):
       Removed unnecessary files. The meta-html profiler module has
       been included to test performance issues.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of metahtml.txt (09-Feb-1999):
       Replaced the old 5.02 documentation, involving minor bug fixes
       in the automatic generation of this file.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Make wml_p2_mhc documentation automatic (08-Feb-1999):
       To keep the wml_p2_mhc documentation up-to-date, it is generated
       from the C sources, as meta-html does. To perform this operation,
       mhc macros have been added to emulate database and stream
       operations.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Added doc in wml_include/std/logo.src (03-Feb-1999):
       Added documentation to the ``target'' attribute.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed configuration (03-Feb-1999):
       With some shells (ksh or sh-posix on HP-UX), the configure script
       failed because the TMPDIR variable is defined to a non-existing
       directory.
       [Steve Sizemore <steve@cmpharm.ucsf.edu>]

    *) Fixed wml (03-Feb-1999):
       Suppress all references to tdist, which does no longer exist.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed wmk (03-Feb-1999):
       Suppress all references to tdist, which does no longer exist.
       Add support to the -P wml option.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed previous patch for perl threads (19-Jan-1999):
       One of the 2 tests on version number was missing.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Upgrade of mhc (19-Jan-1999):
       Upgraded from version 5.02 to 5.09.
       As usually this is a heavily stripped down version of metahtml.
       All about databases, session management, encryption,... is
       removed (see the README.wml file for details).
       Other unused configuration tests are removed (AC_CHECK_FUNCS)
          flock getgrent seteuid setgid setlocale
       Added arch/solaris/prototypes.h. Below in this file it is
       mentioned an obsolete #include was removed for Solaris. Is it
       this one?
       Documentation is not yet updated.
       Documentation inside source files have not been removed to help
       hacking.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Renamed wml_docs/wml_tags.L.core (18-Jan-1999):
       Some *BSD check for files with a .core extension and remove them
       every night. Renamed to wml_docs/wml_tags.L.main
       [Marc Baudoin <babafou@babafou.eu.org>]

    *) Added doc in wml_include/des/typography.src (18-Jan-1999):
       Few lines added to say that <sc> tags support i18n.
       [Märt Laak <Mart.Laak@hansa.ee>]

    *) Fixed a bug with perl threads (18-Jan-1999):
       Added calls to dTHR, needed by perl >= 5.005
       [Hans de Graaff <graaff@xs4all.nl>]

    *) Fixed wml_frontend/wml.src (18-Jan-1999):
       Check whether an equal sign is found after an option, which
       is certainly due to a misunderstanding of how to invoke wml.
       [CHristian Niss <chris@topitmagic.de>]

    *) Fixed the Meta-HTML Autoconfiguration (17-Jan-1999):
       Removed the not necessary Autoconf checks for setpgrp() and vfork()
       because in our heavily stripped down Meta-HTML version these are no
       longer used and the tests just caused problems on some platforms.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

  Changes between 1.6.7 and 1.6.8:

    *) Enhanced the tarball process  (13-Jan-1999):
       The --enable-maintainer-mode option from automake is added to
       `configure'. It is disabled by default, suppressing dependency
       problems that might occur when untarring. To keep all the
       dependencies, maintainers have to specify this option.
       Add a minus sign after gzip, to suppress a fatal error.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fix <import .. format="verbatim"> command (13-Jan-1999):
       Fix the <import src="file.txt"> or <import .. format="verbatim">
       command which was broken because of internal changes in recent
       versions.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Make tarball rolling more flexible (13-Jan-1999):
       The process of rolling the WML distribution tarball is now more
       flexible and secure: It used variables (which can be overridden) for
       the tools and UID/GID 0/0 to avoid security problems (users could
       override installed WML files when WML is installed under root).
       Additionally the rolling process is now aware of the fact that WML
       stays inside a CVS repository.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed wml_frontend/wml.src (13-Jan-1999):
       Protected areas appeared only on the first slice.
       [Heiko Schlittermann <heiko@datom.de>]

    *) Fixed wml_frontend/wml.src (13-Jan-1999):
       Display of timers were corrupted when some passes are skipped.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed wml_backend/p9_slice/slice.src (13-Jan-1999):
       ``make test'' failed because a dollar sign was expanded.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Added wml_contrib/wml.spec (12-Jan-1999):
       This file is used to build RedHat/Linux RPMS (binary packages).
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed wml::sys::boot (12-Jan-1999):
       Two blank lines are suppressed.
       [Marc Baudoin <babafou@babafou.eu.org>]

    *) Removed files in wml_backend/p2_mhc/libmhtml (12-Jan-1999):
       Unnecessary files are removed and Makefile.in is updated.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Enhanced Pass 1 (IPP) (12-Jan-1999):
       The parseblock routine is called only if `/*' is read in input
       file. This causes significant speed-up.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Enhanced wml::des::navbar (12-Jan-1999):
       Added `nopreload' attribute to navbar:render. When set, prevents
       inclusion of javascript code. Useful when navigation bars are
       used more than once.
       Replaced HTML javascript code by the Meta-HTML <javascript> tag.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) Fixed wml::des::navbar and wml::des::gfont (12-Jan-1999):
       Quotes in text attributes cause trouble. Replace quotes by
       perl quoting (q,qq,...).
       [Denis Barbier, clorenz@proddev-linux2.inhouse.compuserve.com]

    *) Enhanced wml::std::box (12-Jan-1999):
       Background color cells can be made in conjunction with headings.
       [Denis Barbier]

    *) New subdir: wml_contrib/ (07-Jan-1999):
       Added a new contribution subdir wml_contrib/ where the Webdesign
       Magnifying Glass (WMG) CGI program is now distributed and where other
       stuff can be added in the future.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed WMU (31-Dec-1998):
       Fixed the download hyperlink in the WMU tool.
       [Denis Barbier <barbier@imacs.polytechnique.fr>]

    *) Upgrade of File::PathConvert (18-Dec-1998):
       Upgraded File::PathConvert Perl module from version 0.3 to 0.83
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of Image::Size (18-Dec-1998):
       Upgraded Image::Size Perl module from version 2.6 to 2.9.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of Bit::Vector (18-Dec-1998):
       Upgraded Bit::Vector Perl module from version 5.2 to 5.6.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed double-backslash (`\\') handling (01-Nov-1998):
       Now in Pass 1 (IPP): a double-backslash prevents line continuation as
       one would expect. This way one can again create lines with backslashes
       at the end.

    *) Fixed `make test' (10-Aug-1998):
       Under situation where WML was configured for a prefix not
       containing `wml' it was failing.
       [Torsten Naumann, Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed wml::std::grid (07-Aug-1998):
       Some <preserve>/<restore> tags were missing for parameters.
       [Markus Fleck <fleck@isoc.de>]

    *) Fixed wml::std::logo (07-Aug-1998):
       It was was broken because of an ePerl syntax error inside logo.src.
       [Torsten Naumann <Torsten.Naumann@Informatik.TU-Chemnitz.DE>,
        Denis Barbier <barbier@imacs.polytechnique.fr>]

  Changes between 1.6.6 and 1.6.7:

    *) Upgrade of ePerl (02-Aug-1998):
       Upgraded ePerl from version 2.2.12 to 2.2.14. 
       This especially provides first Perl 5.005 support ;-)
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Enhanced Autoconf stuff (02-Aug-1998):
       Replaced build user/host/domain/time determination stuff with a new
       `buildinfo' script I've written for Apache which is more robust.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of built tools (02-Aug-1998):
       Replaced mkinstalldirs and install.sh scripts with my cleaned variants
       I've done for Apache 1.3's APACI stuff.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of IO (02-Aug-1998):
       Upgraded IO Perl module from version 1.19 to 1.20.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed wml::des::typography (01-Aug-1998):
       Fixed the <sc>..</sc> tags in wml::des::typography which were confused
       when in the processed body other tags occured.  
       [Kurt D. Zeilenga <Kurt@Boolean.Net>. Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Changed IPP/HTMLStrip (30-Jul-1998):
       Fixed the handling of EOL-comments (#...), now ``\#xxx'' inside style
       sheets works fine again.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed htmlfix pass (30-Jul-1998):
       Corrected the usage synopsis inside the htmlfix manual page.
       [Kurt D. Zeilenga <Kurt@boolean.net>, Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Extended wml::std::logo (29-Jul-1998):
       Added `powered by VIM' logo for wml::std::logo.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed wml_tutorial (26-Jul-1998):
       Make divertion example in wml_tutorial more robust and less confusing.
       [Florian Hars <hars@math.uni-hamburg.de>, Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Fixed wml::des::gfont (05-Jul-1998):
       Fixed two bugs inside wml::des::gfont.
       [Jordan Baker <jbb@interlog.com>, Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Upgrade of txt2html (29-Jun-1998):
       Upgraded txt2html aux tool from version 1.24 to 1.25.
       [Ralf S. Engelschall]

    *) Enhanced wml::std::logo (28-Jun-1998):
       Added `target' attribute to <logo> tag.
       [Florian Kuehnert <sutok@gmx.de>]
    
    *) Fixed WMd page (26-Jun-1998):
       Added missing link to wml::des::preload.
       [Alvise Belotti <alvise@lettere.unipd.it>, Ralf S. Engelschall]
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  I've now changed the syntax of the ChangeLog file for more readability,
  especially for posting ChangeLog entries to sw-wml.
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.6.5 and 1.6.6:

      970617 - upgrade CSS2 document to latest REC 12-05-1998 version

               <andy@gently.demon.co.uk> for patch]
             - Add support to WMd's search feature for compressed/gzipped
               manual pages (for instance under FreeBSD port they are gzipped)
      970622 - Fixed the hostname determine stuff in the configure script
               [Thanks to Clayton Wheeler <cswheeler@halcyon.com> and Aleksi
               Niemelä <AleksiN@hex.fi> for hints]

  Changes between 1.6.4 and 1.6.5:
      980323 - added the HTML Specifications in ASCII form

               <bortzmeyer@pasteur.fr> for hint]
             - Removed stream-stuff from Pass 2 (MHC) because
               it's TCP stuff caused problems on some platforms

  Changes between 1.6.3 and 1.6.4:
      980313 - fixed a few typos in the INSTALL file
      980314 - Upgraded Bit::Vector 5.0 to 5.1
             - Upgraded Getopt::Long 2.13 to 2.15
      980318 - Fixed wml::des::gfont which called gfont
               with option -s instead of -r [Thanks to Andy
               Hawkins <andy@gently.demon.co.uk> for hint]
      980322 - Fixed <vspace> tag in wml::des::space [Thanks to
               Igor V.  Spiridonov <garris@trunk.uco.ru> and
               Tomasz Cholewo <t.cholewo@ieee.org> for hint]
      980323 - Added support for escaped sharp-comments via
               ``\#'' for escaping such comments, for instance
               when needed inside <verbatim> environments [Thanks
               to Igor V. Spiridonov <garris@trunk.uco.ru> for
               hint]
             - Fixed Pass 7 (HTMLfix): Now the width/height=*
               placeholder constructs are removed when the image
               file from <img> tags are not accessible.  [Thanks
               to Igor V. Spiridonov <garris@trunk.uco.ru> for
               hint]
             - Fixed etc/newvers, so that it not always just
               tries to use "cc". Instead now first "gcc" is
               searched and "cc" is the fallback.  [Thanks to Dan
               Ludden <dan.ludden@lmco.com> for hint]
             - Added SCALE=<factor> and SCALE=<percent>% to the
               <img> support in Pass 7. This way you can scale
               the WIDTH/HEIGHT attributes of <img> tags.
               [Thanks to Dan Ludden <dan.ludden@lmco.com> for
               patch]
             - Enhanced the wml::std::toc include file: Now you
               can use ``#use wml::std::toc
               style=pre|nbsp|hspace'' to let the Table Of
               Contents create in a particular style.  The "pre"
               style is the old <pre>-based style, the
               "nbsp"-style used plain HTML text with &nbsp;'s
               and <br>'s and the "hspace" style uses <hspace>'s
               (from wml::des::space) and <br>'s to layout the
               ToC.  [Thanks to Dan Ludden <dan.ludden@lmco.com>
               for idea]
             - Added optional "alt" attribute to <navbar:button>
               which can be used for explicitly setting the <img
               alt=".."> stuff.  It defaults to the value of the
               non-optional "txt" attribute.  [Thanks to Dan
               Ludden <dan.ludden@lmco.com> for idea]
             - Added generated "type" attribute to the generated
               <script> container tag for <javascript> and added
               "defer" attribute for HTML 4.0.  [Thanks to Any
               Hawkins <andy@gently.demon.co.uk> for hint]

  Changes between 1.6.2 and 1.6.3:
      980219 - fixed typo in wml::std::lang manpage
      980222 - made the non-GCC warning just a more harmless
               attention message in the configure script.
      980223 - removed config.args entry from config/Makefile
      980228 - let wml::std::toc create markup code which is more
               weblint-proof [Thanks to Andy Hawkins
               <andy@gently.demon.co.uk> for hint]
      980302 - Upgrade Bit::Vector 5.0b4 to 5.0 final release
             - Changed temporary filenames in WMb frontend
               to avoid problems with at least XEmacs 
               [Thanks to Karl M. Hegbloom
               <karlheg@bittersweet.inetarena.com> for hint]
             - Fixed typo in wml_tutorial.pod [Thanks to Stefan
               `Sec` Zehl <sec@42.org> for hint]
      980304 - Fixed replacement for nested <center>..</center>
               constructs in HTMLfix [Thanks to Stefan `Sec` Zehl
               <sec@42.org> for hint]
             - Fixed the system() call for Pass 2: the arguments
               were not correctly escaped. Thanks to Graham
               Hughes <thrag@treepeople.dyn.ml.org> and Anthony
               Fok <foka@debian.org> for hint]
             - Fixed various typo bugs in a lot of sources
               [Thanks to Anthony Fok <foka@debian.org> for
               patch]
             - Fixed WMu's key handling
             - now %DIR and %BASE are interpolated on the WML
               shebang line which is useful for multi-lingual
               pages [Thanks to Stefan `Sec` Zehl <sec@42.org>
               for hint]
             - added a second box variant to <box> from
               wml::std::box which is a headlined one. The layout
               idea is stolen from the QMail homepage but now
               implemented via WML.
             - now the <lang:area>...</lang:area> container tag
               from wml::std::lang supports a special `(/)' tag
               inside its body to switch back to no special
               language.  pages [Thanks to Stefan `Sec` Zehl
               <sec@42.org> for idea]
      980305 - Solved Bit::Vector license conflict by now
               obtaining a special license for WML directly from
               the author of Bit::Vector. This is needed because
               WML can be used free or charge both in educational
               _AND_ commercial environments while Bit::Vector is
               usually not allowed to be used in commercial
               environments without paying.

  Changes between 1.6.1 and 1.6.2:
      980216 - fixed wml_faq.pod [Thanks to Robin Stephenson
               <robin@gbhap.com> for hint]
             - added "eperlfilter" attribute to <pod> and
               <import> tags to allow post-filtering by an ePerl
               function.
      980217 - fixed FSF address and added --best option
               for gzip on creating the tarball.  [Thanks to
               Anthony Fok <foka@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> for patch]
             - fixed version comparison in the new WMu frontend
               [Thanks to Alvise Belotti
               <alvise@lettere.unipd.it> for hint]
      980218 - removed bogus X%1X debugging stuff from
               wml::std::lang which I forgot to remove.
             - added new <lang:star:href:> tag to wml::std::lang
             - Upgraded Bit::Vector from 5.0b2 to 5.0b4
             - Fixed domainname determination in configure
             - Upgraded to Slice 1.3.2
      980219 - adjusted ANNOUNCE file
             - stripped down the Meta-HTML documentation
               so only features remain WML's Meta-HTML has

  Changes between 1.6.0 and 1.6.1:
      980210 - added hints for "make test" to INSTALL file
             - changed misspelled word: "Divertion" -> "Diversion"
             - made the determination of the WML_GEN_REALNAME and
               WML_GEN_USERNAME variables more robust
      980211 - now wml::sys::boot is only preloaded when actually
               using Pass 3 (ePerl) because it exists only for
               this.  This way "wml -p1" can be a useful command
               for its own.  [Thanks to Jim Hebert
               <jhebert@compu-aid.com> for hint]
             - now the control frontend clears the CGI/1.1
               environment variables to avoid confusion of Pass 2
               and Pass 3 which try to determine their operation
               mode from it.  [Thanks to Jim Hebert
               <jhebert@compu-aid.com> for hint]
      980214 - changed attribute name "interword" to "interchar"
               for tag <spaced> of wml::des::typography, because
               it is actually a inter-character spacing.
               [Thanks to Christian Reiber for hint]
      980215 - added missing wml_misc subdir to Makefile.in
               so this subdir is used on all targets, too.
               [Thanks to the Debian ports diff-file from Anthony
               Fok <foka@debian.org> for hint]
             - Ops, for 1.6.0 I already wanted to removed
               wml_contrib because it is not useful for the end
               user (only for the porters), but I forgot to do..

  Changes between 1.5.1 and 1.6.0:
      980116 - removed configure --enable-compat option
               and wml_include/OBSOLETE* stuff
             - Merged the <box> and <rect> tags from
               wml::std::box into a new full-featured single tag
               named <box>
      980118 - Fixed temporary file usage: /tmp/wml.$$.tmp4 was
               not removed.  [Thanks to Stefan `Sec` Zehl
               <sec@42.org> for hint]
             - Upgraded IO 1.1803 -> 1.1804
             - Upgraded GD 1.16 -> 1.17
             - removed some unnecessary stuff from
               wml_p2_mhc/configure.in
      980119 - recreated the "generated via WML" GIF image
             - added more logos to wml_misc/
             - added new wml::std::logo to insert the logos
             - removed wml::sup::stack because its functionality
               is already in wml::std::tags
             - added domainname attribute to wml::std::info which
               overrides the usage of WML_SRC_HOSTNAME
             - removed wml::usr::rse because no one can use it
               except RSE ;_).
             - added hint to wml_faq.pod on how to setup a useful
               $HOME/.wmlrc and $HOME/.wml
             - fixed WML option -v which needs pre-processing as
               option -r
             - fixed RC file parsing for $HOME/.wmlrc
             - now WML uses the homedir in passwd instead of
               $ENV{HOME}
      980120 - fixed tag recognition in HTMLfix:
               ``<I>foo=bar</I>'' was incorrectly "fixed" to
               ``<I>foo="bar</I">''. [Thanks to Tetsuya Furukawa
               <tetsuya@secom-sis.co.jp> for patch]
             - enhanced the -p option syntax: Now you can use the
               more readable and shorter -p1-7,9 instead of
               -p12345679 for all passes except Pass 8.
             - added details about $HOME/.wmlrc setups to
               wml_faq.pod
             - Some WML tags were renamed to avoid namespace
               conflicts:
               wml::des::navbar <navbar>     -> <navbar:define>
               wml::des::navbar <navdebug>   -> <navbar:debug>
               wml::des::navbar <navrender>  -> <navbar:render>
               wml::des::navbar <nb_header>  -> <navbar:header>
               wml::des::navbar <nb_footer>  -> <navbar:footer>
               wml::des::navbar <nb_prolog>  -> <navbar:prolog>
               wml::des::navbar <nb_epilog>  -> <navbar:epilog>
               wml::des::navbar <nb_filter>  -> <navbar:filter>
               wml::std::case   <uppercase>  -> <case:upper>
               wml::std::case   <lowercase>  -> <case:lower>
               wml::std::tags   <array-size> -> <array:size>
               wml::std::tags   <push>       -> <array:push>
               wml::std::tags   <pop>        -> <array:pop>
               wml::std::tags   <show>       -> <array:show>
               wml::std::info <generated-via-wml> -> <logo name="wml">
      980124 - added new "wmu" frontend
             - added wml_common/termreadkey/
      980126 - moved wml_pX_XXX to wml_backend/pX_XXX
             - added wml_common/delimmatch/
             - fixed DelimMatch version from 1.01 to 1.03
             - expanded "distclean" target in wml_common/Makefile.in
             - added EOL-mode (#) and Block-mode (/*...*/)
               comment support to Pass 1 (IPP) to get rid of
               comments as quick as possible. This way we now
               really can comment out any stuff and as a side
               effect processing is a little bit faster.
             - added wml_common/blockparser/
             - fixed tempfile remove again. This time for the
               case where WML breaks because of a pass error.
             - created the WML test suite and a first t/01-plain.t
      980128 - added -P option to IPP for running prolog programs
             - Upgraded GD 1.17 -> 1.18
             - now the <lowsrc> tag from wml::des::lowsrc skips
               the creation when the xxx.lowsrc.gif already
               exists and has a higher timestamp.
             - now WML uses the new Term::ReadKey at -v3
             - Upgraded to Slice 1.3.1 which fixes Slice
               errors
             - Now all wml_pX_YYY and wml_aux_XXX scripts
               and binaries are installed in LIBDIR/exec/
               instead of BINDIR/.
             - Fixed WMd: Now the ftp:// link works and also runs
               Lynx.
             - Fixed generation of WML command in WMk
      980202 - Now the -V option of all frontends run wml -V..
             - Fixed WMb message generation
             - added new wml_tags.pod manual page
      980204 - Added <lang:star:> tag to wml::std::lang
             - Fixed wml::std::logo
             - Added <say> tag for debugging to wml::std::tags
             - Adjusted PORTING.test for new "make test" approach
      980205 - Fixed wml::std::all because wml::std::case was
               missing [Thanks to Alvise Belotti
               <alvise@lettere.unipd.it> for hint]
      980207 - Renamed --with-cc to --with-forced-cc and added
               a new --with-cc configure option which doesn't
               force CC for Meta-HTML and ePerl to avoid
               conflicts under HP-UX and simular braindead
               systems.
             - Added more info about multi-lingual pages to
               wml_tutorial.pod
             - Fixed built_date determination in configure
      980208 - Adjusted NEWS file
             - Fixed "make test" again
             - Now "make install" automatically runs "make all"
               when it was not run already.
      980209 - Fixed WMu again.
             - Upgraded IO 1.1804 -> 1.19
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.5.0 and 1.5.1:
      980112 - Upgraded to File::PathConvert 0.3
             - Rewritten the ANNOUNCE file
      980115 - The PREFIX/bin is now put in front of $ENV{PATH}
               in all frontends to avoid problems when more then
               one WML installation exists.  [Thanks to Fritz
               Zaucker <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch> for hint]
             - Now WMk and WML correctly escape -o options
               from the shebang lines when they are not quoted
               but contain shell meta chars [Thanks to Fritz
               Zaucker <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch> for hint]
      980116 - fixed another bug in context of quoted -o option
               arguments [Thanks to Fritz Zaucker
               <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch> for hint]
             - fixed the -v1 output because "mhc" and "epl"
               columns usually have two digits before the point.
             - added -v1 to wml_sample/Makefile
             - fixed manual page of wml::std::lang [Thanks to
               Fritz Zaucker <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch> for hint]
             - Rewritten the README file
             - Added the WML_SRC_BASENAME variable to the "wml"
               frontend.

  Changes between 1.4.11 and 1.5.0:
      980101 - Updated Copyright Notices for 1998 and removed
               still left "All Rights Reserved" trailers,
               because this bites with GNU GPL.
      980103 - Upgraded to iSelect 1.0.4: Now WMd is also
               correctly terminated on CTRL-C without crashing
               the XTerm behavior.
      980104 - Changed "make test" to automatically check
               for the installation
             - Added --with-cc=PATH option to configure which is
               equivalent to ``CC=PATH ./configure [...]'' but is
               more intuitive because we already have
               --with-perl=PATH.
             - Adapted and enhanced the PORTING.test script from
               the ePerl distribution for WML platform porting
               tests
             - Upgraded Meta-HTML's config.{guess,sub} files
             - Updated NEWS file
             - Changed Build Date in configure script to ISO
               format
             - Fixed wml_p4_gm4/Makefile.in for AIX 4.2
             - Force etc/install.sh under AIX 4.x because
               their `installbsd' program is buggy
      980105 - Again cleaned up Pass 5 (Divert) because
               divert.src now is a sample implementation of the
               diversion chapter in my dimploma thesis ;_)
      980106 - Added the various package/installation files as
               wml_contrib/pkg/. [Thanks to Jim Hebert
               <jhebert@compu-aid.com> for the RPM version]
             - Added the new wml::std::lang which provides a
               high-level interface for defining the output
               slices for various languages.
             - Upgraded to Slice 1.3.0: This adds a nifty
               feature to WML's -o option. Now one can use
               wildcarded slices like `LANG_*' which means
               the union of all existing LANG_XXX slices.
             - Fixed handling of ``wml -o...:-'', i.e.  when
               stdout is explicitly requested.  WML hang in the
               past waiting for STDIN because unprotect opened
               the "output file "-".
             - Added lession about wml::std::lang to
               wml_docs/wml_tutorial.pod
             - Added <document_url> tag to wml::std::info [Thanks
               to Viorel Anghel <vang@ely.leader.ro> for the
               idea]
      980108 - Adjusted NEWS file for version 1.5
             - Adjusted ANNOUNCE file for version 1.5
      980110 - Fixed new <document_url> canonicalisation
               [Thanks to Viorel Anghel <vang@roedu.net>]
      980111 - Fixed attribute fixing in HTMLfix (Pass 8) for
               <!-- [...] --> which is no real HTML tag.  WML
               incorrectly fixed the following: <!-- vim:set ts=4
               sw=4: --> to <!-- vim:set ts="4" sw="4:" -->.
               [Thanks to Stefan `Sec` Zehl <sec@42.org> for
               hint]
             - let PORTING.test accept "cc -fast"
             - let wml_p2_mhc/configure.in accept "cc -fast" and
               do not use GCC options "-O2 -finline-functions".
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.4.10 and 1.4.11:
      971231 - Upgraded to ePerl 2.2.12: This fixes a nasty
               syntax error in ePerl 2.2.11's configure script.
               The result was that ePerl failed to build when
               your Perl version was not of type 5.00X_YZ :-(

  Changes between 1.4.9 and 1.4.10:
      971228 - Upgraded to Slice 1.2.9
      971230 - Fixed wml_sample/demo.wml: The "slices" attribute
               for <page> has to added now. [Thanks to Anthony
               Fok <foka@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> for patch]
             - Fixed wml_frontend/wml.src because now Slice no
               longer is a special case for -v option. [Thanks to
               Anthony Fok <foka@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> for patch]
             - Upgraded to ePerl 2.2.11: This makes WML the first
               time compliant to the Perl Locale environment,
               e.g.  the <sc> from wml::des::typography now works
               for international characters, too.
             - Upgraded to Bit-Vector 5.0b2
             - Updated COPYRIGHT.OTHERS file
             - Changed Meta-HTML version string from 5.02 to
               5.02/wml to make it clear that this is not a
               complete or standard Meta-HTML.
             - Added another Q&A to wml_faq.pod and fixed
               question numbering

  Changes between 1.4.8 and 1.4.9:
      971224 - Added the contents of the RESTRICTIONS file to
               wml_faq.pod and removed the file.
             - Corrected the FAQ because of new <protect>
             - Added more info to the FAQ
      971226 - Upgraded to GetoptLong-2.13
             - Upgraded to Image-Size-2.5
             - completely cleaned up the Divert (Pass 5) filter
               and enhanced it: Now you can do a named leave,
               i.e. leave a divertion by name which has the
               effect of leaving it and all other divertions
               which were entered from within it.
             - added <page_end> to wml::std::page which can be
               used to end a <page>. This usually is not needed
               in standard situations, but when creating more
               than one page via <page> and slicing then this is
               needed to avoid nesting.
             - Upgraded to IO-1.1803
      971227 - changed the IPP semantics of #include and #use to
               a better one: Now #include really does what it
               says, it unconditionally includes a file, perhaps
               even more then once. On the other hand #use has
               the general "use" semantic where multiple
               inclusion is automatically avoided. Up to this
               time it was not possible to include a file
               (perhaps a navigation bar) more then once, because
               #include also had the multiple inclusion
               detection. Now this is no longer the case.
             - added "slices" attribute to <page> of
               wml::std::page which now has to be used to force
               <page> to create the WML_PAGE_XXX slices.  Because
               these usually make problems when using <page>
               multiple times.

  Changes between 1.4.7 and 1.4.8:
      971221 - added SUPPORT file with info about the new ML
               sw-wml@engelschall.com
      971222 - upgraded from GD-1.14 to GD-1.16
      971223 - added a new trick to HTMLstrip: <suck>, this tag
               absorbs itself and all whitespaces. This is a nice
               feature which is now used in
               wml::des::typography's <tul> container tag to get
               rid of whitespaces.
             - enhanced, cleaned up and documented
               wml::des::typography
             - upgraded to ePerl 2.2.9

  Changes between 1.4.6 and 1.4.7:
      971215 - Created BUGREPORT file
      971218 - Rewritten the <sc> and <csc> tags from
               wml::des::typography to avoid problems with
               acented characters.  BUT NON-ASCII CHARS ONLY WORK
               IF YOUR SYSTEM SUPPORTS LOCALES!  [Thanks to Fritz
               Zaucker <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch> for hint]
             - fixed incorrect scoping for $CFG variable in
               wml::des::navbar which leads to an error under
               some Perl versions.  [Thanks to Fritz Zaucker
               <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch> for hint]
             - Fixed typo in wml::des::all [Thanks to Fritz
               Zaucker <zaucker@ee.ethz.ch> for patch]
      971219 - Fixed and enhanced the attribute fixing in
               HTMLfix.  Now it is tag-sensitive (i.e. name=value
               pairs outside tags are not fixed) and the value is
               no longer restricted to just digits.  [Thanks to
               Carsten Braeutigam <carsten@nada.kth.se> for hint]
             - Now the width/heigth calculation of <img> tags in
               HTMLfix honors the aspect ratio, i.e when only one
               attribute is given, the other one is calculated
               relative to it. [Thanks to Carsten Braeutigam
               <carsten@nada.kth.se> for hint]
             - fixed a few cosmetic source parts
             - because I really dislike the 3rd-party Meta-HTML
               sources, I've again stripped down the stuff. This
               time the GNU malloc was removed (was not used
               under Solaris and Linux and under FreeBSD should
               not) and some other not really needed files.

  Changes between 1.4.5 and 1.4.6:
      971209 - slightly adjusted ANNOUNCE file
      971211 - fixed manpage of the new wml::des::preload
             - fixed a few typos in wml_docs/wml_tutorial.pod
             - rewritten and completed the 1.3->1.4 part of
               the NEWS file.
             - removed unneccessary stuff in Meta-HTML's
               configure
      971212 - fixed row/column spanning of wml::std::grid
               [Thanks to Tetsuya Furukawa
               <tetsuya@secom-sis.co.jp> for patch]
             - enhanced the stripping in HTMLstrip (Pass 8). Now
               HTMLstrip strips according to the three possible
               areas: Inner Tag, Inner Preformatted, Plain Text.
               So, now JavaScript code is no longer stripped
               incorrectly.
             - added a <nostrip> for the <javascript> container
               to wml::std::tag because its useful here.
             - added a <nostrip> for the <script> container to
               wml::des::navbar because its useful here, too.
             - added $(name:*string) syntax to IPP (Pass 1) to
               allow real if-then-else constructs in combination
               with the already existing $(name:+string)
               construct.
             - added some stuff to wml_tutorial.pod
             - disabled warnings also for include files in
               wml::sys:boot now to get rid of nasty warnings
               when PERL5OPTS="-w" is set by the user.  [Thanks
               to Oliver Hensel <oliver.hensel@gmx.de> for hint]
             - upgraded to Slice 1.2.8
      971215 - made username/realname determination more robust
               against special chars like backticks [Thanks to
               Stefan `Sec` Zehl <sec@42.org> for hint]
             - now WML:Break-errors return the correct status and
               rc numbers.
             - another frontend for the user: WMb -- Website META
               Language Bug Report Tool.

  Changes between 1.4.4 and 1.4.5:
      971205 - made configure's determination of the FQ-hostname
               more robust
             - added hint so S-Lang curses as an alternative to
               NCurses
             - made WML's username/realname determination more
               robust
             - done a lof porting tests on various platforms.
               See PORTING file for details.
      971209 - let wml/aux/Makefile.in stop on errors in subdirs
             - slightly changed INSTALL file
             - made Term::Cap usage more robust in WMk and
               HTMLinfo because under some systems this does not
               work for all terminal types.
             - made MakeMaker's processing more quiet in
               wml_common/Makefile.in according to the uninstall
               warnings
             - removed MakeMaker manpage
               creation/installation/deleting for
               wml_common/Makefile.in
             - added new wml::des::preload include file for
               preloading images
             - again fixed the image width/height determination
               stuff in HTMLfix.

  Changes between 1.4.3 and 1.4.4:
      971130 - fixed Pass 1 (IPP): the #use and #include argument
               handling was not restored after first usage.
      971201 - added <nb_filter> to wml::des::navbar because
               sometimes one really needs some Perl stuff to
               fixup some aspects of the generated HTML code
               which cannot be done statically.
             - fixed wml::des::rollover which was broken because
               of the change in WML 1.4.2
             - enhanced Pass 7 (HTMLfix) so you can specify
               width/height attributes with a value of ``*''.
               There the asterisk is replaced by the correct
               image size while without any such attribute
               HTMLfix just adds the missing attribute. And
               HTMLfix now also can just add one missing
               attribute when the other still exists.
             - adjusted ANNOUNCE file
             - adjusted RESTRICTIONS file
             - fixed WMk subdir movement display

  Changes between 1.4.2 and 1.4.3:
      971129 - fixed libsubdir handling again
      971130 - now the new wml::des::navbar killer include file
               is finished and included as
               wml_include/des/navbar.src.
             - created new wml_contrib/ dir and placed
               my .vimrc's WML stuff into it

  Changes between 1.4.1 and 1.4.2:
      971124 - added support for the global variable GFONT_BASE
               to wml::des::gfont for redirecting images to a
               global place.  [Thanks to Carsten Braeutigam
               <carsten@nada.kth.se> for hint]
             - system variables like WML_GEN_HOSTNAME now can be
               overwritten by -D options. This is useful for the
               <info> tag from wml::std::info to get the
               EMail-address correct.  [Thanks to Carsten
               Braeutigam <carsten@nada.kth.se> for hint]
             - documented the "notag" attribute of wml::std::gfont 
               which was undocumented up to this time.
             - added two Q&A to wml_faq: How to combine <gfont>
               with <href> and how to combine <gfont> with
               <rollover>.  [Thanks to Carsten Braeutigam
               <carsten@nada.kth.se> for answering]
             - added "hint" attribute to <rollover> similar to
               the one from <href> and let the URL display if no
               such attribute is given.  [Thanks to Carsten
               Braeutigam <carsten@nada.kth.se> for idea]
      971127 - upgraded Bit::Vector from 4.2 to 5.0b1
             - upgraded to Slice 1.2.7
      971128 - slightly fixed Pass 8 (HTMLstrip) for inter-tag
               attribute stripping
      971129 - removed possible conflict inside
               wml::des::rollover with the new wml::des::navbar
               which is currently under development.
             - fixed wml::OBSOLETE::path and wml::sup::relpath
             - renamed wml::sup::relpath to wml::sup::path
             - added canonpath() function to new wml::sup::path

  Changes between 1.4.0 and 1.4.1:
      971124 - fixed Version-id update for wml_frontend/wmd.txt file
             - Corrected and Enhanced the INSTALL file
             - upgraded to iSelect 1.0.2: This makes WML again
               more portable, because this iSelect is the first
               one which is widly portable between major Unix
               derivates.

  Changes between 1.3.5 and 1.4.0:
      971114 - ** again cutted down wml_p2_mhc. This time all
               database and session stuff (which is not needed
               under WML) was completely removed.  This way the
               wml_p2_mhc is smaller, build time is reduced and
               the distribution contains fewer unneccessary
               files.
             - adjusted ANNOUNCE file for WML 1.4
      971115 - ** reversed option -s: now is stands for --safe
               instead of --speedup and the default now is to use
               the speedup hacks.  Because experience with WML
               1.3.x showed that this works great and reduces
               processing time dramatically
             - ** added wml_frontend/wmd.src which is the
               new WML Doc Browser
             - added wml_aux/iselect/* (iSelect 1.0.0) for
               the new WMd frontend.
             - fixed wml/wmk/wmd -V option (@libsubdir@ was missing)
             - make wmk and wmd -V option similar to wml -V
      971117 - upgraded to ePerl 2.2.8
      971118 - changed wml_p8_htmlstrip stripping, so ``#.*''
               is a comment and not only #[#!\n\s]*.* This was
               done in the past intentionally, but I forgot the
               reason, so we'll see ;_) [Thanks to Heiko
               Schlittermann <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
      971120 - added "target" attribute to <rollover> tag from
               wml::des::rollover [Thanks to Carsten Braeutigam
               <carsten@nada.kth.se> for hint]
      971123 - made Perl's warning option quiet ;_)
             - ** added long-awaited <protect
               [pass=SPEC]>..</protect> internal container tag
               which can be used to protect any data from
               processing by _any_ pass.  While protections can
               occur after any pass, the final output data is
               unprotect after pass 9 only.  [Thanks to Carsten
               Braeutigam <carsten@nada.kth.se> for forcing me to
               create it now]
             - fixed WMk handling when option -a is used [Thanks
               to Stephen van Egmond <svanegmo@truespectra.com>
               for hint]
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.3.4 and 1.3.5:
      971112 - upgraded to Slice 1.2.6 which fixes a nasty
               slice term calculation bug.
      971113 - added <rect> container tag to draw rectangles
               to wml::std::box.
             - corrected shebang hint in WMK manpage and added
               shebang documentation to WML manpage
             - added automatic adding of mailto: and http://
               to wml::std::href for URLs.  [Thanks to David
               Mentre <David.Mentre@irisa.fr> for idea]
             - added a smaller generated-via-wml logo and added a
               size=N attribute to the <generated-via-wml> tag
               from wml::std::info.  [Thanks to David Mentre
               <David.Mentre@irisa.fr> for idea]
      971114 - added support for -V<N> where <N> is 1,2 or 3 to
               get detailed information about WML and Perl for
               bug reports.
             - adjusted VERSIONS.HISTORY and CREDITS file
             - fixed a few typos in INSTALL file
             - fixed autoconf stuff for determining the
               domainname via /etc/resolv.conf's "search" entry.
             - formally upgraded to IO-1.1802 (no changes)
             - renamed wml_sample/00README to wml_sample/README 
             - changed wml_sample/Makefile to also test
               speedup-mode

  Changes between 1.3.3 and 1.3.4:
      971108 - removed "All Rights reserved" from Copyright
               notice because this one and the usage of GPL are
               mutually exclusive.  
               [Thanks to Bruce Perens <bruce@debian.org> for hint]
      971110 - rewritten some regex stuff in HTMLfix (pass 7)
               which was ok for Perl 5.004 but too complicated
               for 5.003.  Perl 5.003 is buggy here.  [Thanks to
               Carsten G. Braeutigam <carsten@3point.net> for hint]
             - added a little more verbosity also for case where
               WML runs with option -s and -vN where N >= 2.
             - added an attribute named "target" to the <href>
               tag from wml::std::href to be able to use
               hyperlinks which load the new page into a
               particular targer frames
             - removed the pre-generated pages from wml_sample to
               be able to run a useful "make test" 

  Changes between 1.3.2 and 1.3.3:
      971107 - fixed wml_sample according to new wml::std::page
               which defines some slices, so UNDEF now is UNDEF2.
               [Thanks to David Mentre <David.Mentre@irisa.fr> for hint]
             - fixed inconsitency in wml debugging where the user
               was prompted to display the result even for pass 9.  
               [Thanks to David Mentre <David.Mentre@irisa.fr> for hint]
             - upgraded to ePerl 2.2.7
             - fixed some typos in wml_docs/*

  Changes between 1.3.1 and 1.3.2:
      971102 - fixed wrong xtable-example in wml_tutorial.pod
               [Thanks to Boris Wesslowski <bwess@gmx.de> for hint]
             - added new wml::std::case include file which
               provides HTML tag translation to upper or lower
               case. [Thanks to Boris Wesslowski <bwess@gmx.de>
               for idea]
             - again fixed some blank lines which were generated
               by wml::std::page.
      971103 - fixed ASubst (pass 6) case where file directly
               starts with the block delimiter. This was not
               recognized.
             - enhanced wml::std::case to correctly translate tag
               attributes and moved this now very complicated
               regex stuff into wml_p7_htmlfix as internal
               container tag <tagconv>. Now wml::std::case is
               just a high-level frontend.
             - slightly adjusted ANNOUNCE file

  Changes between 1.3.0 and 1.3.1:
      971019 - fixed entity in WML manualpage
      971022 - fixed <verbcode> in wml::std::typography
             - renamed <indent> from wml::std::typograhy
               to <pind> because of conflict with wml_p7_htmlfix
             - added num=0 to <indent> to remove leading
               whitespace box from a paragraph.
      971024 - removed wml_common/00README and added the
               missing information to COPYRIGHT.OTHERS file
             - upgraded to IO-1.1801
             - adjusted ANNOUNCE file
      971026 - fixed .wmlrc parsing: now quoted strings
               are handled exactly the way the Bourne-Shell does, i.e. 
               foo=bar quux   => "foo=bar", "quux"
               "foo=bar quux" => "foo=bar quux"
               foo="bar quux" => "foo=bar quux"
               where the last one is an important one, too.
             - changed imgdot height to 16 pixels (a little bit
               greater then 12) for <pind>/<ein> tags of
               wml::des::typography to get a better look
      971027 - added -A (accept) and -F (forget) options to WMk
             - added -r (norcfile) to WMk, too.
             - added -x (exec-prolog) and -X (exec-epilog) to WMk
             - fixed WMk to be able to process files with "::" in name
             - upgraded to ePerl 2.2.6

  Changes between 1.2.3 and 1.3.0:
      971006 - added nice <indent>..</indent> feature to
               wml_p7_htmlfix
             - now wml::std::page supports bgcolor=none which
               means "do not specifiy bgcolor=.. at all".
      971008 - fixed wml_p6_asubst: options on substitution
               strings were not parsed correctly
             - added WML_STDPAGE_XXX slices to wml::std::page
      971009 - created wml::des::imgbg to batch create background
               GIF images
      971010 - enhanced the -v1 processing time output: now 
               a table is displayed showing exact times of
               each pass
      971014 - added <toc_hN> tags to wml::std::toc
             - cleaned up the WMk and WML options description in
               manual page and usage pages and added correct
               support for GNU long-options.
             - added support for out-commenting tags to pass 7
               (htmlfix). Now one can comment out a tag by just
               adding a # to its name.
             - added a little useful and often needed feature to
               wml::std::typography. When adding "face_shortcuts"
               to the #use line, all ``face=helvetica'' strings
               are replaced by ``face="Arial,Helvetica"''.
             - added option -r/--norcfile to WMk and WML.
      971015 - !!! added the new *EXPERIMENTAL* -s option to WML and
               !!! WMk which stands for _SPEED_UP_. This option
               !!! enables the pre-compiling of the passes which can
               !!! speed-up the processing _dramatically_!!
             - fixed IPP (pass 1) for option -s handling
             - fixed aSubst (pass 6) for option -s handling
             - fixed HTMLfix (pass 7) for option -s handling
             - fixed HTMLstrip (pass 8) for option -s handling
             - upgraded to IO-1.18
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.2.2 and 1.2.3:
      970914 - fixed whitespace handling in wml::des::imgdot
             - fixed <ifdef> in wml::std::tags
             - fixed wml::des::space which was broken because
               of braindead variable scoping in Meta-HTML. ARGL!
             - fixed WMk error message 
      971004 - upgraded to Getopt::Long 2.12
             - upgraded to WebLint 1.020
             - fixed <ifdef> tag in wml::std::tags support
               [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
               <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
             - fixed argument parsing on #include lines:
               arguments after a boolean argument were lost
             - now IPP supports a backslash in front of the
               $(xxx) syntax to prevent the interpolation of
               $(xxx). And when xxx is not defined, it
               now interpolates to the empty string. This way
               it now has the Bourne-Shell semantics.
             - added Bourne-Shell-like $(xxx:-yyy), $(xxx:=yyy),
               $(xxx:+yyy) and $(xxx:?[yyy]) syntax variants to
               IPP (Pass 1).
      971005 - fixed IPP usage display page
             - fixed WMk usage display page
             - now -DNAME~PATH is also supported on the commend
               line: here PATH is adjusted to the dir where the
               ``wml'' command was run from.  [Thanks to Heiko
               Schlittermann <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
             - added -D option to IPP to be able to also define
               IPP variables for the top-level/initial file
             - now WML also passes its defines (-D option) to IPP
               via IPPs new -D option
             - fixed ``-DROOT~.'' case where ROOT was set as
               "../" instead of ".." which is usually needed.
             - added a long-time missing feature to
               wml::des::imgdot: now when no filename base is
               specified but the variable IMGDOT_BASE is defined
               (usually via .wmlrc as -DIMGDOT_BASE~path) then
               this is one is taken instead of the source
               filename base. This provides a flexible way to
               shared imgdot images.
             - rewritten the output of wml_aux_htmlinfo:
               now a nice table is printed to STDOUT instead
               of the old and ugly indented list.
             - added "global" feature to wml::fmt::isolatin

  Changes between 1.2.1 and 1.2.2:
      970831 - added URL to ImageMagick homepage to wml::des::gfont
             - added hints about third-party programs to INSTALL file
             - added -DDEBUG=1 support to wml::des::imgdot; now
               when this options is activated the 1pt dot images
               always contain red color and are thus visible.
             - enhanced <spaced> container tag of
               wml::des::typography; now it can space the text
               per character (via &nbsp;) _and_ per line (via imgdots)!
             - created wml::OBSOLETE include file for defining
               old tagnames in addition to old files which are
               under wml::OBSOLETE::xxx.
      970901 - fixed wml::sys::all [Thanks to Stephen van Egmond
               <svanegmo@truespectra.com> for hint]
             - fixed std/info.src: <pageinfo> -> <info> as intended.
             - fixed and enhanced width-handling of
               wml::std::grid [Thanks to Stephen van Egmond
               <svanegmo@truespectra.com> for hint]
             - fixed wml_p8_htmlstrip case where a newlines is in
               front of a non-preformatted area
             - disabled #-style comments for Pass 4 (GNU m4)
               because this caused big problems with
               xxx="#rrggbb" and is a totally unnecessary feature
               because WML already provides #-style comment
               support [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
               <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
      970903 - Upgraded to ePerl 2.2.5
             - Upgraded to File-PathConvert-0.2
             - Upgraded to Image-Size-2.4
      970905 - Updated wml:des::gfont for new gFONT 1.0.0
             - Now wml::des::rollover automatically names the
               images if the "name" tag is not given

  Changes between 1.2.0 and 1.2.1:
      970825 - fixed typos in wml_tutorial.pod
             - removed some unnecessary stuff from Makefile.in of
               wml_p2_mhc/libutils
      970826 - added some links to the include files
             - added support for "-i wml::category::file" to IPP
               and WML.
             - overhauled the document wml_intro.pod
             - slightly changed ANNOUNCE and README files
      970828 - added IPP option -m to load mapping files
             - added the old obsolete WML 1.1.0 include files for
               backward compatibility
             - created wml_include/compat.map with entries for
               wml::OBSOLETE stuff
             - removed left-over debugging statements in IPP
             - removed wml_include/TODO file
             - created --enable-compat option for configure to
               enable the installation of wml::OBSOLETE stuff
             - upgraded to Slice 1.2.5
      970829 - created first version of a WML Make (wmk) in
               wml_make. This is high-level frontend to wml like
               xmkmf for imake is.
             - slightly fixed wml_docs/wml_tutorial.pod
             - merged wml_main and wml_make into wml_frontend
             - moved wml_aux_XXX to wml_aux/XXX
             - moved sample/ to wml_sample/
             - fixed shebang support of wml
             - added "make test" to wml_sample/Makefile
             - again added config.guess and config.sub to etc/
             - now the built environment is determined and
               wml/wmk -V now display this information
             - created PORTING file
             - added dummy "test" target to top-level Makefile.in
             - updated VERSION.HISTORY file for all versions
             - added a new <spaced>..</spaced> container tag to
               wml::des::typography for spaced text (german:
               "gesperrter Text")
             - added first try for a WML FAQ as wml_docs/wml_faq.pod
             - now htmlfix also recognizes xxx=+dddd attributes
             - fixed wml::imp::generic
             - fixed wml::des::typography
             - fixed again wml_common/gd/ for "distclean" target
             - added info about long-options to wmk
      970830 - fixed OBSOLETE.map (.src -> .wml): [Thanks to
               Heiko Schlittermann <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
             - make MakeMaker stuff under wml_common more quiet
             - added the built locations to -V option of WML.
             - added WML_LOC_XXX variables which hold the built
               locations
             - added <generated-via-wml> tag to wml::std::info
               which inserts the generated-via-wml.gif file as a
               button.
             - fixed determination of domainname/hostname  in GNU
               autoconf.

  Changes between 1.1.0 and 1.2.0:
      970819 - removed wml_aux_gfont because it cannot
               be configured cleanly from within WML distribution
               (its libfiles don't fit well for installation and
               runtime) and this program alone is not sufficient.
               So when one need TeX, one can also install this
               little programm externally.
      970820 - added REQUIRES lines to include manpages
             - put javascript container tag into wml::std::tags
               and removed wml::app::javascript
      970821 - speed up the case where ``wml'' receives an empty
               input file: Now this implies -p9, i.e.  only the
               output pass is used. 
             - added one single but really essential feature to
               Pass 2 (Meta-HTML): The asterisk from tags
               (``<tag* ...>'' and ``</tag*>'') are removed. This
               way you can easily overwrite standard HTML tags im
               Meta-HTML but you are still able to use the
               standard variant directly within the definition by
               adding an asterisk.
             - fixed Pass 8 / htmlstrip: It removed the final
               newline in a file also which looks ugly
             - fixed --with-openworld option description in GNU
               autoconf [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
               <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
             - made a kludge to wml_common/gd/libgd/Makefile.PL
               to workaround an existing MakeMaker bug where the
               Makefile is not removed on "distclean".   [Thanks
               to Heiko Schlittermann <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for
               hint]
             - changed the "use lib" stuff in wml::sys::boot to a
               BEGIN/@INC variant to avoid conflicts in Perl's
               lib.pm 
             - upgraded to ePerl 2.2.3
             - removed obsolete wml::des::imgsize. His job
               is already done by Pass 7 (htmlfix)
      970822 - enhanced wml::des::grid, now it has no longer real
               restriction on which data can be put into cells.
      970823 - replaced wml::std::headfoot by a more powerful and
               clean wml::std::page include file which provides a
               singe <page> tag instead of the old and ugly
               <header>/<footer> tags.
             - renamed wml::std::url to wml::std::href because it
               does not provide a <url> tag; it provides a <href>
               tag.
             - removed wml::msc::m4 and put the stuff from this
               file into wml::std::tags.
             - removed wml::std::divert and put the stuff from
               this file into wml::std::tags.
             - renamed wml::msc::path to wml::msc::relpath and
               its function from from_to() to relpath().
             - renamed wml::std::stack to wml::msc::stack because
               this is also just a snippet
             - removed wml::std::symbol and put the stuff into
               wml::std::tags
      970824 - overhauled more include files
             - created wml_docs/ dir with wml_intro.pod and
               wml_tutorial.pod files
             - fixed the subdir movement strings of wml_p4_gm4
               and wml_common
             - moved some POD stuff from wml_main/wml.src to the
               new wml_docs/wml_intro.pod
             - again stripped down wml_p2_mhc (~100KB)
             - added new feature to IPP (Pass 1): Now one can set
               variables after #include/#use which are
               interpolated via $(..). And there are now to
               special string: __FILE__ and __LINE__ which are
               similar to CPP.
             - made a workaround for the "file" POD problem of
               IPP manualpage.
      970825 - fixed again htmlstrip (Pass 8)
             - written wml_tutorial.pod

  Changes between 1.0.4 and 1.1.0:
      970817 - Fixed examples in wml(1) manpage [Thanks to Heiko
               Schlittermann <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
             - fixed long-standing problem with ``-DXXX=YYYY''
               (didn't worked in the past) vs.  ``-D XXXX=YYYY''
               (always worked).  The problem lies in
               "$Getopt::Long::getopt_compat" defaulting to 1 in
               Getopt::Long module :-(.  [Thanks to Heiko
               Schlittermann <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
      970818 - upgraded to Getopt::Long 2.10
             - changed "perl_private" subdir in libdir
               to just "perl" because looks ugly
             - added a remove command to wml_common/Makefile.in
               for manual stuff which gets created by the
               MakeMaker install targets
             - added some descriptive info to install target to
               be able to easier follow an installation.
             - added fallback to "more" for $ENV{'PAGER'} in
               wml_main/wml.src
             - fixed recently introduced problem with Getopt::Long
               installation [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
               <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
             - changed --with-closedworld to --with-openworld and
               reversed meaning: Now WML per default installs its
               own private copies of Perl modules.  This is more
               safe. Now when one really wants to use existing
               versions he has to specify this option explicitly.
             - ** removed a lot of unneccessary GNU autoconf stuff **
             - made builds under wml_p2_mhc and wml_p4_mhc more quiet 
             - big cleanup wml_common/Makefile.in
             - renamed PROBLEMS file to RESTRICTIONS
             - merged ANNOUNCE and ANNOUNCE.ADDR files
             - fixed nasty bug in Divert which caused recursion
               warnings and missing output where really no
               recursion was [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
               <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for hint]
      970819 - upgraded to SLICE 1.2.4: now WML also accepts
               empty input files which is nice when it used in a
               pipe where it should not complain about these.
             - fixed a few include files and generally replaced
               #include with the more compact and more readable
               #use variant
             - created a useful wml::app::toc whic automatically
               generates a table of contents out of <Hn>...</Hn>
               tags.  [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
               <heiko@lotte.sax.de> for forcing me to think about
               this idea]
  ___________________________________________________________________________

  Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4:
      970814 - fixed wml_main option -O which was incorrectly
               passed through.
             - removed "perl -c" check in
               wml_p9_slice/Makefile.in which caused problems
               under some installations
             - now wml correctly removes its temporary files 
               when an error occurs in a pass.
             - make container body end delimiter in wml::fmt::*
               more unique to avoid conflicts with body contents.
             - added <podfile> to wml::fmt::pod and <verbfile>
               to wml::fmt::verb
      970815 - fixed the private perl5 install paths, the "wml"
               subdir is now correctly added to "libdir" when it
               does not already contain a substring "wml".
               [Thanks to Henrik Theiling
               <theiling@CoLi.Uni-SB.DE> for hint]
             - fixed demo.wml from the webpages and added
               it to the distribution under sample/
             - changed "my" construct in wml_p9_slice which
               caused problems under Perl 5.003 because only Perl
               5.004 allows "my" inside "foreach" [Thanks to Rene
               Pijlman <R.W.Pijlman@inter.nl.ne> for hint]
             - slightly changed syntax of wml_p6_asubst to avoid
               conflicts with plain text [Thanks to Henrik
               Theiling <theiling@CoLi.Uni-SB.DE> for hint]
             - enhanced wml::fmt::isolatin to be really more
               complete, i.e. it now converts most of the ISO
               Latin 1 characters.  [Thanks to Henrik Theiling
               <theiling@CoLi.Uni-SB.DE> for code]
             - renamed wml::fmt::{pod,sdf,text} to
               wml::imp::{pod,sdf,text}
             - renamed wml::fmt::verb to wml::fmt::verbatim
               and made it more simple by using asubst
             - added wml_aux_wwwtable and corresponding
               wml::imp::wwwtable for really nice HTML table
               generation via expert syntax
             - fixed distclean target in wml_p9_slice/Makefile.in
      970816 - fixed typo in wml::std::url [Thanks to Henrik
               Theiling <theiling@CoLi.Uni-SB.DE> for hint]
             - added MANIFEST file and correspodning make
               creation target for better patchfile generation
             - made the installation prefix really variabel so
               one can use "make prefix=.." to override it.
               [Thanks to Heiko Schlittermann
               <heiko@os.inf.tu-dresden.de> for idea]
             - cleaned up configure.in
             - removed strip commands from Makefile.in while
               addding -s to INSTALL_PROGRAM and replacing the
               script installations with INSTALL_SCRIPT calls.
               This fixes problems for the FreeBSD ports.
             - added "#use type::class::item" to wml_p1_ipp
             - removed some more unnecessary files ;_)
             - replaced complete slice distribution with
               a stand-alone variant and upgraded to Slice 1.2.3
             - fixed wml_common/getoptplong/Makefile.PL
             - fixed wml_common/io/Makefile.PL
      970817 - again overhauled wml_aux_htmlinfo

  Changes between 1.0.2 and 1.0.3:
      970814 - *** fixed a bug in htmlstrip recently introduced which
               caused destroyed generated markup code!! ARGL! ***
             - upgraded to weblint 1.019
             - fixed problem in wml_main: using -p12345678 to see
               the result on stdout without processing by pass 9
               (slice) was broken
             - added -O<LEVEL> option to htmlstrip for optimizing
               (regarding byte length) the HTML code.  Also added
               this option to wml_main for passing to to
               htmlstip.
             - Upgraded to ePerl 2.2.2
             - added info to wml_aux_htmlinfo about which number
               of imaga references and how much bytes of data or
               really unique (because only that counts because
               browsers don't load more then once). So -E htmlinfo 
               now is more useful.
             - fixed wml_include/std/fileinfo.src
             - fixed wml::fmt and wml::imp include files
             - added sample to wml_aux_txt2html/txt2html.txt

  Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.0.2:
      970812 - rewritten htmlstrip: now it works
               also with multiply tags on a line and
               additionally strips more whitespaces
             - fixed MANIFEST of wml_common/gd/ which
               was broken in 1.0.1 due to remove of io.h
      970814 - fixed wml_common/gd/libgd/gd.h which
               still wants io.h
               [Thanks to Henrik Theiling 
                <theiling@coli.uni-sb.de> for hint]
             - upgraded to Slice 1.2.2 which introduces
               the %!slice construct. This makes WML
               even more flexible ;_)
               [Thanks to Andrew Pimlott 
                <pimlott@abel.MATH.HARVARD.EDU> for idea]
             - created VERSION.HISTORY file

  Changes between 1.0.0 and 1.0.1:
      970808 - fixed libdir adjustment in configure.in
             - added --with-closedworld option to configure
               to be able to force WML to install all Perl
               modules privately.
             - added --with-perl=PATH option to configure
               to be able to force the use of a specific perl
             - added --with-perl=PATH option to configure
               of wml_p9_slice
             - replaced -f by -x in configure for perl test
             - fixed malloc.h problem in wml_common/gd/libgd/
      970811 - upgraded to SLICE 1.2.0: 
               THIS SPEEDS UP WML PASS 9 _DRAMATICALLY_!
               Now the processing to for pass 9 is no longer directly
               proportional to the length of the written files.
             - fixed reference to Bit::Vector 4.0 in configure
             - fixed install target of wml_common/Makefile.in

             - added wml::des::rollover for RollOver-style
               images which can be used like img-tags
      970807 - enhanced htmlfix to do more HTML fixups
             - removed testdir t/, because we currently
               have no way to do a real "make test" 
               before "make install". The tests need
               WML to be already installed.
             - created wml::fmt::sdf for the Simple
               Document Format (SDF) embedding 
             - fixed wml::fmt::pod for pod2html from Perl 5.004_02

             - upgraded to SLICE 1.1.1
             - fixed a problem a correct substituted
               generating wml.1

  Changes between 1.0b15 and 1.0b16:
      970428 - added wml_aux_gfont
      970429 - added -m 755 to INSTALL_PROGRAM define
             - added warning for non-GCC compilation
               to configure
             - changed wml::des::gfont to use 
               new private wml_aux_gfont
      970502 - replaced wml_aux_webxref with 
               enhanced successor wml_aux_linklint

  Changes between 1.0b14 and 1.0b15:
      970423 - added wml_aux_webxref
             - adjusted weblintrc
             - fixed manpage of wml
             - upgraded to Image-Size-2.3 and
               fixed wml_common/00README
             - created Test::Harness based test suite
               and a first test for plain throughput
             - replaced destroyed COPYING file with
               a fresh one from prep.ai.mit.edu
      970427 - upgraded to final ePerl 2.1.0 release
               and fixed the changed calling options
               in wml

  Changes between 1.0b13 and 1.0b14:
      970423 - changed wml manpage slightly
               to make pass4 and pass5 more distinct
             - added -t option to wml which sets
               the mtime of outputfile(s) to mtime
               of inputfiles
             - fixed outputfile epilog/time handling
             - now -v can get an optional numeric argument
             - now -v means only -v1 and this does only
               display the total processing time
             - upgraded to slice-1.1.0 which now uses
               Bit::Vector 4.0 instead of Set::IntegerFast 3.2

  Changes between 1.0b12 and 1.0b13:
      970417 - created a new wml::imp::remote
             - created unfinished wml::std::img
             - now wml also processes options
               from a pseudo-shebang line. Use this
               for instance to remember the output options
               like
                  #!wml -o... -o...
               and compile the file just via
                  $ wml file.wml
             - removed the demo/ subdir from the
               distribution. It is intended for
               the webpages or a seperate distribution
             - removed wml_p9_slice/lib/ because
               it is not used
             - removed the duplicated COPYING files
      970422 - fixed a few include files
             - added preserve/restore facility to wml::std::tags
      970423 - fixed preserve/restore tags
             - rewritten wml::des::grid with preserve/restore
             - fixed wml_include/Makefile and wml itself
               for temporary files: they are now removed
               and named more unique. 
             - upgraded to ePerl 2.1b6
             - now -v gets passed to some filter passes
             - now htmlfix gives out the total amount
               of bytes the images accumulate on a page
               on option -v.
             - added weblint 1.017 to the distribution
               as wml_aux_weblint. This is inteded as
               a manually used epilog filter
             - created a wml_aux_htmlinfo which
               summarizes the content of a webpage
             - added -E option to wml for running epilogs

  Changes between 1.0b11 and 1.0b12:
      970410 - created new include cathegory "imp"
             - moved wml::des::csmap to wml::imp::csmap
             - created a new wml::imp::view
      970413 - fixed wml::des::typography
      970416 - fixed a few include files
             - documented more include files

  Changes between 1.0b10 and 1.0b11:
      970409 - added wml_aux_map2html
             - removed the list of include files in wml.src
               and added a new updated list to wml_include/all.src
             - renamed msc -> app and old sup -> msc
             - again added a lot of stuff to include files
             - added all.wml files for all cathegories
             - fixed "make install": the aux-files were missing
             - renamed eg -> demo and added the complete
               installation of this dir to "make install"
             - removed htmltoc and toc.src because
               of a principle restriction of WML this
               cannot be used in a really useful way :-(
             - changed PROBLEMS file
      970410 - fixed a quoting problem for -D option
               and put a warning in the wml manpage
               then -DFOO=BAR is not allowed due to
               restrictions in Getopt::Long. We always
               have to use -D FOO=BAR (note the blank)
             - created the first contents for the demo/ area
             - now wml can also read from STDIN, i.e.
               it can now be used as real Unix filter
             - now the inputfile can also be completely
               missing which also means "read from stdin"
               but additionally forces quiet mode. This
               is useful for pipes ..| wml |...

  Changes between 1.0b9 and 1.0b10:
      970408 - fixed ANNOUNCE file
             - added more info to INSTALL file
             - now pod2man tempfiles while building are removed
             - added file existence tests to pass 4-6
             - added the long-missing feature of pass 7:
               htmlfix now does what it was intended to do.  It automatically
               adds WIDTH/HEIGHT and ALT attributes to IMG tags.
             - created a nice pod.wml which convertes between
               POD and HTML via pod2html
             - created a nice text.wml which convertes between
               TXT and HTML via txt2html
      970409 - again reorganized wml_include/. Now
               the things are sorted into subdirs
             - now the include file sys/boot.wml is
               automatically pre-loaded before any others
             - reworked wml::des::grid to use a divertion
               for cells (this way you can use any contents)
             - created a nice wml::fmt::verb include file
             - fixed the -i '<...>' option for wml
             - fixed a lot of stuff in the include files
             - added wml_aux_txt2html
             - added wml_aux_htmltoc
             - created a wml::std::toc which used
               wml_aux_htmltoc

  Changes between 1.0b8 and 1.0b9:
      970408 - greatly optimized wml_p5_divert
               which had a really horrible performance
               in 1.2b8 (big files need 10minutes and more
               to process, now only a few seconds)
             - added "-q" (quiet) option to wml which
               prevents the prop from being displayed
             - added "-i file" option to be able to pre-load
               include or template ;-) files.
             - allowed "_" as an additional character
               for Divertion names in wml_p5_divert
             - fixed a nasty bug in wml_8_htmlstrip when
               nested preserved blocks occured.
             - changed the make scheme for the *.src
               files. Now they are no longer substituted
               by configure. Instead a sed is done.
             - added the functionality to discard
               divertions and to overwrite a divertion.
               This is actually the last missing feature
               to allow real templates!

  Changes between 1.0b7 and 1.0b8:
      970406 - finally introduced the first missing pass: GNU m4.
               (intended for general low-level macro processing)
             - finally introduced the second missing pass: divert
               (intended for special divertion filtering)

             - added information about include files
               to wml's manpage

      970403 - changed a few manpages

               "use libs ..." for the privately installed Perl modules

      970406 - documented the first set of include files
             - renamed typographic.wml to typography.wml

             - removed the old silly contents of eg/

             - fixed pod2html call, because new pod2html
