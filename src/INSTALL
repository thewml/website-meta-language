 INSTALLATION
 ============

[Note: Cygwin users see INSTALL.CYGWIN.]

 1. Overview for the impatient
    --------------------------

    $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/wml
    $ make
    $ make test
    $ make install

 2. Requirements
    ------------

    The following requirements exist for building WML:

    o  Disk Space: 
       Make sure you have 8 MB of temporary free disk space.  After
       installation WML occupies approximately 3 MB of disk space.

    o  Perl Interpreter: 
       Make sure you have Perl 5.003 (works, but perhaps problems can occur),
       Perl 5.005 (works best) or later already installed on your system. You
       can find the homepage of Perl on <URL:http://www.perl.com/> and the
       Perl distribution on <URL:http://language.perl.com/info/software.html>.

    o  ANSI-C Compiler: 
       Make sure you have an ANSI-C compiler installed.  The GNU C compiler
       (GCC) from the Free Software Foundation (FSF) is recommended. You
       can find the homepage of GNU on <URL:http://gcc.gnu.org/> and the
       GCC distribution on <URL:ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/>.
    
    o  SVr4 compatible Curses library: 
       Make sure you have a SVr4-like Curses library installed. If your
       systems Curses library is not of this time, then you have to install
       one of these free variants:
           - GNU NCurses, Version 4.2 or 5.0 recommended:
             <URL:ftp://ftp.clark.net/pub/dickey/ncurses/>
             (works best, so this is recommended to use)
           - S-Lang, Version 1.4 recommended:
             <URL:http://www.s-lang.org/>
             <URL:ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/>
             (works ok, but a little bit restricted)
       ATTENTION! The standard `old' BSD Curses library does _not_ work. So,
       under SunOS and other old BSD-based systems you really need NCurses or
       S-Lang installed. The modern BSD-variants like FreeBSD and NetBSD
       already have NCurses, of course.

 3. Configuring the source tree
    ---------------------------

    The next step is to configure the WML source tree for your particular
    system/platform. The important information here is to set a location
    prefix where WML is to be installed later, because WML has to be
    configured for this location to work correctly.

        $ ./configure --prefix=/path/to/wml/
                     [--with-perl=/path/to/bin/perl]
                     [--with-perl-opts=string]
                     [--with-cc=/path/to/bin/cc]
                     [--with-forced-cc=/path/to/bin/cc]
                     [--with-openworld]

    Use the --with-perl option to configure WML to use a particular Perl
    interpreter on your system. Usually WML will use the latest one it is able
    to found.

    Use the --with-cc option to configure WML to use a particular C compiler
    for building C language sources, except for ePerl, because this package
    usually checks its own for a suitable compiler.  It needs to be
    compiled with the same compiler the Perl system was compiled on your
    system.

    Use the --with-forced-cc option to configure WML to globally use a
    particular C compiler for building C language sources, including sources
    in the ePerl package.

    Use the --with-openworld option to let WML's configure script test for
    already existing Perl modules in your Perl system.  This way WML can use
    the already installed versions of those modules if present.  Per default
    WML installs private copies of the used Perl modules to be maximum
    independed of the underlaying system and to avoid problems when the Perl
    system is upgraded.

 3. Building the toolkit
    --------------------
    
    Now you can build the programs, manpages and include files which form the
    WML toolkit by running the command

       $ make 

    Please be patient, this takes approximately 2 minutes to complete on a
    Pentium-II/400 platform. 

 4. Testing the toolkit
    -------------------

    Now you can partially test the toolkit by running a small test suite via:

       $ make test

 5. Installing the toolkit
    ----------------------
    
    Now its time to install the toolkit's programs in $prefix/bin, the
    manpages in $prefix/man and auxiliary, include and Perl-Module files in
    $prefix/lib/ (or $prefix/lib/wml/ if $prefix does not already contain the
    string `wml'!):

       $ make install

    For the paranoid hackers under us: The above command really installs under
    $prefix _only_, i.e. no other stuff from your system is touched. I say
    this explicitly here, because I hate "make install"'s which destroy parts
    of my system, too. But the amount of installation steps is too huge to do
    it manually, really!

    One special case for package maintainers: If you want to install the stuff
    inside a different location than the pre-configured one (for instance when
    creating system packages via dpkg under Debian GNU/Linux or RPM under
    RedHat Linux, etc), you can alternatively use

       $ make install prefix=/somewhere/tmp

    This will install the toolkit inside /somewhere/tmp for rolling the
    package tarball, although the toolkit is still configured for the correct
    prefix (specified at point 3).

 6. Additional programs
    -------------------

    While the WML toolkit itself is a self-contained all-in-one package which
    comes with all parts it needs under runtime, there are some include files
    (see wml::all(3)) which need third-party programs to be able to provide
    their full functionality:

    o wml::fmt::sdf 

      To use this include file you need the Simple Document Format (SDF)
      package. You can find the package at <URL:http://www.mincom.com/mtr/sdf/>.

    o wml::des::gfont
      
      To use this include file you need at least the gFONT program from
      Ralf S. Engelschall which can be found at
      <URL:http://www.engelschall.com/sw/gfont/>.
      And because this program makes use of an underlaying TeX installation,
      you should be sure that TeX is already installed on your system. If not
      I recommend you to install teTeX which can be found at
      <URL:http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/systems/unix/teTeX/> or any CTAN
      mirror.

      Additionally when you want to use the `crop' attribute of the <gfont>
      tag (which crops empty edges of the generated image) then you also
      have to install the ImageMagick package which can be found at
      <URL:http://www.wizards.dupont.com/cristy/ImageMagick.html>.
