  ePerl -- Embedded Perl 5 Language

  Version 2.2.14 (02-08-1998)

  ePerl interprets an ASCII file bristled with Perl 5 program statements by
  evaluating the Perl 5 code while passing through the plain ASCII data. It
  can operate in various ways: As a stand-alone Unix filter or integrated Perl
  5 module for general file generation tasks and as a powerful Webserver
  scripting language for dynamic HTML page programming.

  The documentation and latest release can be found on
