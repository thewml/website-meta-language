# What is it?

Website Meta Language is an offline HTML preprocessor, which dates back to
the 1990s and is written in Perl 5 and C. It can be used for
[static site generation](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) . Note that, while
being powerful and capable, it is somewhat slow, has a lot of legacy conventions
and practices behind it, may be somewhat hard to learn, and in general is
not recommended for new projects, and you should probably use a different
[static site generator](https://staticsitegenerators.net/) for new projects,
including possibly a custom home-grown one based on a build system and a
template system or a preprocessor.

based on Website Meta Language (similar to the relationship between
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) above [TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX) ) - the link contains some further reflection on the contemporary
situation of choosing a static site generator.
